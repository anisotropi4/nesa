       Running around a train in London Bridge platform 2
       Locomotives running round an engineering train from the London End of London Bridge platform 2 must be run into a
       platform at Cannon Street station to enable the driver to change ends of the locomotive.
       Where both the train and locomotive will fit within the confines of Platform 2, the locomotive may be ‘called on’ to the train
       in platform 2. The train will start back on the authority of the Platform 2 starting signal TL2425 and/or any other instructions
       given by the signaller
       Where an engineering train that is to be run round exceeds the overall length of platform 2 and occupies any of the track
       circuits BLN, BLP, BLM, BLP, BLS, the locomotive must be run round the train via Platform B at New Cross and return to
       London Bridge via 2 Reversible line and signal TL2422 or TL2420 (as appropriate) will be used to ‘Call On’ the locomotive
       onto the train/wagons.
       The driver before exiting the locomotive to couple the train/wagons together and/or change ends, will contact the signaller
       and request either line 1 Down or line 3 Up to be blocked. (This will depend upon which side the conductor rail is located).
       The signaller will block the line requested by the driver in accordance with General Signalling Regulations 13.1 between
       signals:
                  Line         From Signal     To Signal
                 1 Down         TL2533          TL2537
                  3 Up          TL2524          TL2520

       Once the locomotive has been coupled and the driver/any other staff (shunter) involved, are in a position of safety on the
       locomotive/clear of the running lines, the driver must contact the signaller and give up the line blockage.
       The train will start back on the authority of signal TL2427.
       The driver must advise the signaller when the train is ready to depart, obeying the aspect shown on signal TL2427 and/or
       any other instructions given by the signaller.
       Running around a train in London Bridge platform 8
       Engineering trains being run round using platform 8 must not exceed 24 SLU’s plus locomotive(s) (equivalent of 12 mk1
       coach lengths)
       Once detached from the train, the locomotive will run round the train/wagons via platform 9 and then signalled onto 7
       Reversible line behind signal TL2224.
       When the Locomotive has stopped behind TL2224 on line 7 Reversible, the driver must contact the signaller and request
       the adjacent line 8 Up to be blocked to enable the Driver to change ends of the locomotive.
       The signaller will block the adjacent line 8 Up in accordance with General Signalling Regulations
                 Line           From Signal    To Signal

                 8 Up             TL2028        TL2026


       The driver must change ends using the walkway between line 7 Reversible and 8 UP and when back in a position of
       safety on the locomotive; the driver must contact the signaller and give up the line blockage.
       The locomotive will then be signalled on to the train/wagons in platform 8.
       The train will start back on the authority of the Platform 8 starting signal TL2831 and/or any other instructions given by the
       signaller.
