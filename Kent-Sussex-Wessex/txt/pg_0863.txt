       Use of Staff Protection Lock-Out Device (PLOD) in connection with Handbook 8 and Handbook 21 at Axminster
       A Protection Lock-Out Device (PLOD) is provided for the sections of line shown in the table below. When the PLOD is
       operated, train movements over the section of line concerned are stopped and locked out by the signalling system.
       The PLOD key/switch must be considered to be a “single line staff or token” for the purposes of applying this procedure
       (as shown in Handbook 8 – section 2.5)
       The SWL/COSS/IWA must agree with the signaller, which line will be affected and carry out the necessary arrangements
       to operate the Staff Protection Lock Out Device for the section concerned before the protection is granted.

       When it is necessary for an up train to terminate and start back in the down direction from platform 2 via SE4809 signal.
       Drivers are reminded that there is no Automatic Warning System (AWS) equipment provided for SE4809 signal and the
       AWS magnet located at the country end of platform 2 is associated with SE4800 signal in the up direction only. This
       magnet is ‘supressed’ and departing down trains will not receive any AWS indications for this movement.
