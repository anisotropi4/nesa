       Trains struggling to make significant progress with risk
       of becoming stranded due to icing conditions
       Following incidents during the winter period with trains becoming disabled owing to ice and snow on the conductor rail the
       following shall apply:
       Driver actions
       If the driver experiences their train struggling to make progress or severe arcing, they shall:
         • Follow company-specific instructions for driving when power draw is affected by ice on the conductor rail
         • If unable to make significant progress and still experiencing severe arcing STOP, make a GSM-R URGENT call
           and state to the signaller that “THIS IS AN ICE CALL” advising the signaller of your situation
         • If not in a station, continue with the steps above until you reach a station or until you are clear of ice and are
           making significant progress (advise the signaller of this)
         • Follow the signaller’s instructions, keep the passengers informed and ask for assistance from any staff members
           that may be on board the train
         • When in a station, release train doors If all train doors are adjacent to a platform
         • If some train doors are not adjacent to a platform, advise passengers of the situation and tell them you will
           release doors manually before you do so
         • If you have been unable to evacuate part of the train (e.g. where there is no through-connection to part of the
           train that is not within a platform), Advise remaining passengers of the situation and prepare to carry out an
           emergency evacuation once you have the required response staff available

       Signaller actions
       When a signaller receives an “ICE CALL” from a driver they shall:
         • Establish the location of the train, its length, whether fully or partially in a station, agree with the driver whether
           further attempts to move the train will be made and then take the following actions in the specified order:
         • Instigate a GSM-R general broadcast to advise other drivers in the area that there is a stranded train as per the
           agreed script and in accordance with GSM-R Handbook RS523, Section 8.2
         • Call Control stating: “THIS IS AN ICE CALL”, then give the following information: Train [Headcode], formed of
           [stock formation] is failing to make significant progress at [location]. The train is / is not / is partly in the platform at
           [location]
         • Call adjacent signal boxes stating: “THIS IS AN ICE CALL”, then give the following information: Train [Headcode],
           formed of [stock formation] is failing to make significant progress at [location]. The train is / is not / is partly in the
           platform at [location]. If you are the signaller receiving the above call from another signaller, immediately arrange
           for trains to be diverted away or held at stations, making a general broadcast to drivers if required
         • All signallers involved must then assess their area of control to determine whether there are trains trapped
           outside stations and the options available for moving them into platforms, such as Emergency Permissive
           Working or wrong direction movements

       Control actions

       When a controller receives an “ICE CALL” from a signaller, they shall:
