       SO510 - LONDON BRIDGE TO EPSOM DOWNS
       Norwood Down Yard
       Goods Road – Electrified Siding
       The Windmill Bridge Junction end of the Down Yard has been electrified to enable 12 coach trains to recess. Trains will
       normally recess during times of perturbation or late running only. To enable Drivers to change ends safely, short
       platforms and suitable lighting have been provided.

       There is no authorised walking route to/from the siding, as it is not the intention to berth traffic for a long period of time.

       The electrified siding is under the control of the Signaller at Three Bridges Signalling Centre.

       The electrified siding will be protected under Rule Book Handbook 13 for engineering work.
