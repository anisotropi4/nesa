        Establish the location of the train, its length, whether fully or partially in a station, agree with the driver whether
         further attempts to move the train will be made and then take the following actions in the specified order:
        Instigate a GSM-R general broadcast to advise other drivers in the area that there is a stranded train as per the
         agreed script and in accordance with GSM-R Handbook RS523, Section 8.2
        Call Control stating: “THIS IS AN ICE CALL”, then give the following information: Train [Headcode], formed of
         [stock formation] is failing to make significant progress at [location]. The train is / is not / is partly in the platform at
         [location]
        Call adjacent signal boxes stating: “THIS IS AN ICE CALL”, then give the following information: Train [Headcode],
         formed of [stock formation] is failing to make significant progress at [location]. The train is / is not / is partly in the
         platform at [location]. If you are the signaller receiving the above call from another signaller, immediately arrange
         for trains to be diverted away or held at stations, making a general broadcast to drivers if required
        All signallers involved must then assess their area of control to determine whether there are trains trapped
         outside stations and the options available for moving them into platforms, such as Emergency Permissive
         Working or wrong direction movements

Control actions

When a controller receives an “ICE CALL” from a signaller, they shall:
        Immediately task a MOM to attend site stating: “ICE CALL received from the signaller at [location]. Train
         [Headcode], formed of [stock formation] is failing to make significant progress at [location]. The train is / is not / is
         partly in the platform at [location]” and obtain an ETA to site. Then WITHOUT taking any further telephone calls,
         advise the Route Control Manager and train operator controller, repeating the message from the signaller exactly
         as it was received and which MOM is attending
        The controller will liaise with other signal boxes to ensure no more trains approach the affected area and are
         diverted away
        The Route Control Manager must immediately and WITHOUT taking any further telephone calls, advise the
         Incident Officer stating: “ICE CALL received from the signaller at [location]. Train [Headcode], formed of [stock
         formation] is failing to make significant progress at [location]. The train is / is not / is partly in the platform at
         [location]
        The control team must urgently consider communication to passengers, supplementing the information supplied
         by train crew
