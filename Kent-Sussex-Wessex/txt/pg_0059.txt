       Section 2, Clause 2.4 – Using a track circuit operating device
       Wessex Route

       The use of an approved Track Circuit Operating Device (T-COD) is authorised throughout Network Rail Kent, Sussex and
       Wessex Routes subject to the conditions shown below, and as shown in the following tables.
       Note: If a section of route or location is not shown in the left hand column and it does not show it as prohibited
       ion the righthand column, a T-COD must not be used.
       Only the following T-CODs are currently approved for use on Network Rail Kent, Sussex and Wessex Routes.
       • TCOD Bullhead rail (SAFE 7265) 0057/052991
       • TCOD Flat bottom rail (SAFE 7239) 0057/052992
       • Manufacturer: Safetrack Baavhammer AB (May be identified as “TRACK WARNING”, ‘SAFETRACK SAFE’ or
         ‘TRACK’)
       • Remote Tcods and their location for use are detailed within the standard NR/L3/OPS/009
       • The type ZKL-3000 T-COD manufactured by Duel Inventive Cat No – 0057/052973 in authorised for use
       • The type ZKL 3000 RC T-COD manufactured by Duel Inventive Cat No – 057/052993, serial PA05/03898 may only
         be used I non-DC-electrified areas.
       The following must be noted and understood before using a manual Tcod:
       • must not be used on a track circuit affected by track circuit failures, broken rail or negative bonding defects or repairs
       • must not be used on a line equipped with axle counters
       • must not be used where permissive working applies, (as indicated by the ‘remarks’ PP, PP-A, PP-S, PP-C and PF in
         Table A of this publication),
       • must not be used on the approach to an OD, AHBC, ABCL or AOCL level crossing
       • must not be applied between the signal protecting a CCTV or MCB level crossing and the level crossing itself
       • must not be applied in “fourth” rail electrified areas
       • must not be applied where check or guard rails are provided
       • must not be used where there are single rail track circuits on third rail DC lines (identified by a yellow plastic cover on
         the underside of the rail)
       • must not be used where track circuits in sidings are present
       • must not be used on a Tokenless Block line
       • may only be used by a person trained and certified competent in the use of the T-COD to be applied
       • may only be used in areas where signals are controlled or maintained by the operation of track circuits
       Cautionary Notes:
       • Applying a T-COD near points may inhibit the use of some signalled routes which are not affected by the work
       • Applying a T-COD on a section of line that becomes part of an overlap track circuit may inhibit the use of some
         signalled routes which are not affected by the work
       • Applying a T-COD in an area where TOWS is fitted will prompt a continuous warning from the TOWS warning
         equipment
       • T-COD’s must be applied either on the approach to the worksite or within the first signal section of the worksite
         itself. The presence of converging routes must be considered when planning protection by T-COD.
