Sevington “Gotcha WILD” (Wheel Impact Load Detection)
Wheel load impact detection monitoring (Gotcha WILD) equipment is installed on the Up and Down Main line at 58m 42ch.
The purpose of this equipment is to minimise the possibility of track damage caused by wheel defects or overloaded
vehicles and to provide details of all trains with wheel loads outside acceptable limits.
It measures train / vehicle wheel loads and impact forces and is programmed to alert Kent Route Control when Alarm
levels are generated.
In the event of an Alarm activation the Kent Route Control will contact the Workstation 4 Signaller at Ashford Integrated
Control Centre and advise of the action required by the Signaller dependent upon the level of alarm generated.
