Lockout Protection Systems
The “lockout” systems provide a safe method of signal protection on lines shown in the following table.
The area protected and instructions for its operation are displayed at each “lockout” instrument.
The “lockout” may be used instead of protection arrangements referred to in Rule Book Module TS1 Regulation 13 and
Handbook 8 and 20.
The person requesting protection must be either a certified ‘’Safe Work Leader’’, “Controller of Site Safety” (COSS) or
“Individual Working Alone” (IWA).
Method of Protection
When a “lockout” system is to be used to provide protection, the following procedure must be observed:-
a)    The SWL/COSS/IWA must telephone the Signaller giving his/her Name, Grade, Employer, location and contact
      telephone number. He/she must state which “lockout” section they require to be protected by and the time duration. If
      use of the “lockout” is agreed, the Signaller must record these details in the train register book and repeat them back
      to the SWL/COSS/IWA who must confirm they are correct. When satisfied the arrangements are correct, the Signaller
      may authorise the SWL/COSS/IWA to operate the lockout device controls to the ‘Locked Out’ position. The
      SWL/COSS/IWA must observe the instructions displayed and remove the lockout key.
b)    When the protection is no longer required, the persons working under the control of the SWL/COSS must be moved to
      a position of safety and briefed on the changed protection arrangements. When the line(s) is/are clear and safe for
      trains to run on, the SWL/COSS/IWA must advise the Signaller of his/her Name, Grade, Employer location and contact
      telephone number. He/she must state which “lockout” section they require to restore to normal operation.. When
      advised to do so by the Signaller, he/she must replace the Key, and operate the lockout device controls to the ‘Traffic’
      (returned to normal operation) position. The Signaller must be advised and he/she must check that the normal
      indication has been restored. The Signaller must advise the SWL/COSS/IWA and make an entry in the train register.
c)    The SWL/COSS/IWA who gives up the “lockout” protection, must, except in exceptional circumstances, be the same
      individual who obtained the “lockout” protection.
In exceptional circumstances, the SWL/COSS/IWA may hand over to a relief provided he/she advises the Signaller of the
Name, Grade, Employer, location, and contact telephone number of his/her relief.
Lockout systems are provided between the following locations:


NOTE – Platform, bridge and Patrolman’s Lockouts are published as Local Instructions under their relevant line of
route headings.
