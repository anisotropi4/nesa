SO110 - VICTORIA TO RAMSGATE (VIA HERNE HILL AND CHATHAM)
ST MARY CRAY To SWANLEY

Swanley WHEELCHEX
Wheel load impact detection monitoring (WHEELCHEX) equipment is installed on the Up Fast line and the Up Slow line at
16m 08ch.
The purpose of this equipment is to minimise the possibility of damage to track caused by wheel defects or overloaded
vehicles and to provide details of all trains with wheel loads outside acceptable limits.
It measures train / vehicle wheel loads and impact forces and is programmed to alert Kent Route Control when Alarm
levels are generated.
The Network Rail Route Control Manager must action the alarms generated by advising the signaller(s) concerned that
trains are to be brought to a stand using the normal signal sequence and any further action will depend upon the level of
alarm generated.
                                                                                                         Dated: 07/03/09

facing trains in the Up direction, to warn drivers of approaching trains.

A series of signs worded: ‘DANGER Do not lean out of the window’ are provided along the entire length of the bridge to
warn both traincrew and passengers on trains passing over the bridge.
