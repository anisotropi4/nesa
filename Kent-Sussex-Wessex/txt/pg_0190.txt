       Protecting a stabled train on a platform line
       Kent & Sussex
       A platform line on which a train is stabled may be blocked under the arrangements shown in rule book handbook 8 but
       only if protection is provided to stop a train making an unauthorised movement.
       When a platform line is to be blocked and a train is stabled on that line, the IWA, COSS or PC must place the following
       train protection equipment on the train before allowing the work to start:
         1) During daylight: a “NOT TO BE MOVED” board, or a red flag.
         2) During darkness, fog or falling snow: a red light (steady or flashing).
       The IWA, COSS or PC must make sure the protection is displayed on the platform side of the train:
         1) at the end from which the train is to be driven, or
         2) at both ends of the train if it can be driven from either end.
       The arrangements shall apply at the following locations
         1) On platform lines at terminal stations
         2) On dead end bay lines at through stations
         3) On the running lines shown in “Berthing of trains - Sussex Route” in the electronic and hard copies of the
            Sectional Appendix.
