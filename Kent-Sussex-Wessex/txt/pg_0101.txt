Breakdown Appliances
General

Breakdown cranes are no longer allocated to the Kent, Sussex and Wessex Routes. Requests for breakdown and
recovery services on infrastructure controlled by the Kent, Sussex and Wessex Routes are made via the Control Manager.
The permission of the Territory Structures Engineer must be obtained before a crane is allowed to work, or is prepared for
use whilst standing on a bridge, arch or viaduct. Similarly, the owner’s representative responsible for the maintenance of
the sidings must be consulted before a crane is taken into sidings, to ensure that it will not foul permanent structures or
traffic on adjoining lines and that curves and underbridges can be safely negotiated.

     •      Old Oak Common
     •      Cardiff Canton
     •      Toton
     •      Crewe
     •      Thornaby
