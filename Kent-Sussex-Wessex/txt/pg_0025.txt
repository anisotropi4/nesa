       Rule Book Module P2 - Working single and bi-directional
       lines by pilot
       Section 1 - Circumstances
       Kent Route

       Should there be a failure of a track circuit or signal on the lines indicated between the undermentioned locations and the
       Signaller is able to obtain a ‘direction of traffic flow’ indication for the direction concerned, Working by Pilot need not be
       introduced but the Signaller must advise the Driver of the circumstances and instruct them to pass the signal at danger
       and, if necessary, to proceed cautiously over the affected portion of the line.
       However if Working by Pilot has been introduced, it must not be withdrawn until after the failure has been rectified, or the
       service withdrawn. If it is necessary to run trains after the withdrawal of Pilotworking, and the original fault still exists, then
       Working by Pilot must be re-introduced for every train.
       The Rule Book, Module P2, Section1 ‘Working of single lines by Pilot is modified accordingly.
