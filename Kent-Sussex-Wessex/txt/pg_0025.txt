Rule Book Module P2 - Working single and bi-directional
lines by pilotman
Section 1 - Circumstances
Sussex Route

Should there be a failure of a track circuit or signal on the lines indicated between the undermentioned locations and the
Signaller is able to obtain a ‘direction of traffic flow’ indication for the direction concerned, Working by Pilotman need not
be introduced but the Signaller must advise the Driver of the circumstances and instruct him to pass the signal at danger
and, if necessary, to proceed cautiously over the affected portion of the line.
However if Working by Pilotman has been introduced, it must not be withdrawn until after the failure has been rectified, or
the service withdrawn. If it is necessary to run trains after the withdrawal of Pilotworking, and the original fault still exists,
then Working by Pilotman must be re-introduced for every train.
The Rule Book, Module P2, Section1 ‘Working of single lines by Pilotman is modified accordingly.
