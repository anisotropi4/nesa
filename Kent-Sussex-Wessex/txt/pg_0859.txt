       Shawford “Wheel Impact Load Detection” (WILD) -`Wheelchex`
       Wheel load impact detection monitoring (WILD) equipment is installed on the Down# and Up Main line at 68m 60ch.
       #NOTE:
            Only the down direction is currently in operational use.

       The purpose of this equipment is to minimise the possibility of track damage caused by wheel defects or overloaded
       vehicles and to provide details of all trains with wheel loads outside acceptable limits.
       It measures train / vehicle wheel loads and impact forces and is programmed to alert Wessex Integrated Control Centre
       (WICC) when Alarm levels are generated.
       In the event of an Alarm activation the Control will contact the Shift Signaller Manager, or Signaller on Panel 1 or 2 at
       Eastleigh ASC as necessary and advise of the action required by the Signaller dependent upon the level of alarm
       generated.
