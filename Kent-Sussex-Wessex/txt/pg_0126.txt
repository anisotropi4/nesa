       Engineer’s Sidings
       When the points leading to these sidings are normally clipped and padlocked out of use they must be used only for
       engineering purposes, the keys to the padlocks being held by the appropriate person. Before using the points, the person-
       in-charge must:-

         1 obtain the Signaller’s permission and have a clear understanding with them regarding the moves to be made.
         2 take possession of the line concerned.

       Before giving up the possession they must ensure that the points are again secured in the proper position and advise the
       Signaller accordingly.
