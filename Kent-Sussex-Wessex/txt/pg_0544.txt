SO130 - CHARING CROSS/CANNON STREET TO DOVER
PRIORY/EUROTUNNEL INTERFACE (VIA TONBRIDGE)
Shakespeare Tunnel
Class 395 units
If a train becomes disabled after entering the tunnel, or is unable to continue to exit the tunnel, the driver will attempt to
stop the train at the special marker boards positioned in the tunnel.

If the train is unable to be moved clear of the tunnel, in either direction, then arrangements will be made to evacuate the
passengers into a train standing in the opposite bore using one of the special cross passage way platforms located within
the tunnel. The special marker boards are fixed to the tunnel wall to assist drivers of these units stopping their train at a
suitable cross passage way connection.
                                                                                                              Dated: 05/09/09

Owing to the restricted clearances in Shakespeare tunnel only trains fitted with gangways and end vestibule doors are
permitted to convey passengers through the tunnel. Locomotive hauled trains are only permitted to convey passengers
through the tunnel with a locomotive at the leading end.
However if the train consists of any vehicle that has inward opening doors then it is permitted for such train to operate with
a locomotive at each end (top & tailed) if required.

1        KVB Train Protection System
1.1      KVB is a train protection system using on-board equipment and beacons on the track.
         KVB will:
         •   constantly monitor and control the maximum speed of trains
         •   monitor the speed of trains approaching colour light signals displaying a “DANGER” aspect
         •   monitor the passing of colour light signals displaying a “DANGER” aspect
         •   monitor the speed of trains approaching a reduction in permissible speed
1.2      Location
         The KVB train protection system is fitted to signals on the International Chords and Platforms 3 and 4 in Ashford
         station. The purpose of this system is to give SPAD protection and speed monitoring to Eurostar trains which are
         not fitted with AWS or TPWS.
         The system is invisible to trains not fitted with KVB. Southeastern high speed trains are fitted with KVB and will
         encounter some fitted signals. The following instructions apply in this area.
1.3      List of fitted signals
         Signals controlled by Ashford Workstation 4 signaller:
         AD669, AD671, AD672, AD674, AD947, AD949, AD954, AD956.
         Signals controlled by the Ashford HS1 signaller:
