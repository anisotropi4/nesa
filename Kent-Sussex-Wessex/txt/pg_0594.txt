Until the failure is rectified or working by pilotman is introduced the Signaller will allow trains to proceed over the bi-
directional line in the direction elected, authorising the Driver to pass any affected signals at danger in accordance with the
Rule Book, Module S5.
The South London Reversible line will always be elected in the Down direction
If Working by Pilotman has been introduced it will not be withdrawn until the failure has been rectified, or the service
withdrawn.

Passing Signals at Danger - Forward Route Setting
Due to conductor rail gapping issues, the signals listed below are provided with ‘Forward Route Setting’ controls. These
signals require the route to be set before the signal in rear will clear to a proceed aspect. This is to avoid trains stopping
on the approach to the signal and becoming gapped.
When it is necessary to pass a signal with ‘Forward Route Setting’ controls at danger, the Signaller will give the driver
authority to pass the affected signal at danger from the signal in rear to avoid a train stopping at the affected signal and
becoming gapped. Where possible, the Signaller will set the route from the affected signal to enable the signal in rear to
clear to a proceed aspect after the Driver has been given the necessary instructions.
If it is not possible to set a route from a signal with ‘Forward Route Setting’ controls and it is necessary to pass both the
affected signal and signal in rear at danger, the Signaller will authorise the driver to pass both signals at danger from the
first signal. It will not be necessary for Temporary Block Working to be introduced in this instance.
