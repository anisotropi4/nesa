Section 2, Clause 2.3 – Disconnecting signalling equipment
Protection Arrangements
For the purposes of this procedure a track circuit may be considered as part of the signalling controls.
Points which can be disconnected, maintained, and detected, in one position which could be used to prevent trains approaching
may also be considered part of the signalling controls.
Where reliance is placed on a track circuit showing occupied, a signalling technician disconnecting signalling equipment must
make sure that the protection is not compromised by the setting of a shunt, call-on or warning class route, nor the approach
control of main aspects.
