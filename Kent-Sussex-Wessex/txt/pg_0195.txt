Wagons fitted with buckeye couplings
Wagon types JHA, JNA, JTA, JUA, JYA and KEA are operated in sets. A train may consist of more than one set of
wagons, the ‘inner wagons are fitted with Buckeye type E/f couplings both ends and have no buffers. The ‘outer’ wagons
are fitted with E/F coupling at one end and screw couplings at the other end
Any instanter-fitted wagons MUST be formed to the rear of these wagons and PGA 51t wagons to the rear of those on all
loaded trains.
Disengagement of couplings
To part vehicles (e.g. due to hot axle box or other defect) the buckeye must be disengaged. This is achieved by the
operation of the fixed handle attached to each coupling. The handle must be lifted firmly for a short movement outwards;
no significant force is required. Only one handle on either side of the coupled vehicles needs to be lifted to achieve
separation. The coupling will separate as vehicles are drawn apart.
Re-engagement of coupling
This should be performed on straight, level track. One or both knuckles should have been opened by means of lifting the
disengagement handle. The vehicles are brought slowly together until the knuckles snap shut.
The coupling should be tested to ensure that it is secure by gently drawing ahead after re-engagement to ensure the
vehicles remain coupled.
