       • *X** used for services which run with restrictions which can be implemented only by the signaller (such as OPPOS),
         whether freight, passenger or ECS
       • Note:  *X** run ex-ARS and must be signalled manually
       •   *X** is not to be used for trains with only routing restrictions
       A range of options are required for trains with routing restrictions because these can vary greatly. Because rolling stock
       must be positively gauge cleared for each route over which it is to operate it is likely that rolling stock will carry restrictions
       of some sort. One of the following methods are to be used in Southern Region to identify services running with routing
       restrictions:
       • • *Q** for services which must not be run off planned route, running line or path or which have significant routing
         restrictions
       • • Use of a nominated specific range of head codes for services which have a limited number of restrictions, for
         example a restriction in just one signal box area or when pre-agreed by the relevant Route Operations team
       • • Some services with restrictions require no specific precautions or notification, for example passenger stock where
         the only restrictions are in locations where they are not required to operate.
       For operation of new services, the head code strategy is to be agreed with the relevant Route operations team and a
       record kept of the agreed decision and the rationale for it. This policy is not intended to change practices that are currently
       well established and work without problem (such as the operation of freight trains carrying container traffic under
       RT3973CON).
       VSTP Planning
       Southern Region Control teams are able to manage VSTP pathing for trains with gauge or routing restrictions but to
       enable adequate consideration, full details of the relevant restrictions must be supplied to the VSTP team. The following
       will be required:
       • • A minimum of 24 hours’ notice must be provided to enable due diligence in establishing a suitable path and
         preparing the necessary notices
       • • The VSTP request form must be submitted by the requestor with the restrictions box correctly completed and
         either the applicable RT3973 or SoC attached with the request
       • • The Control team will identify whether a suitable path can be found, check the suitability of the head code to be
         used using the guidance above, prepare and issue a suitable notice using the guidance above and advise
         signalboxes on Route either directly (for Southern Region locations) or via Route Controls (for off-Route locations)
       • • The VSTP requestor is responsible for ensuring that the correct version of any RT3973 or SoC is submitted and
         in the event of any discrepancy the VSTP request will be declined
