Before a movement is commenced the Person in Charge must give details to the Signaller who must, when the complete
route has been set and the appropriate signals cleared, indicate the route which the movement will take and the point to
which it is to run. When the Trainmen have been informed the movement may commence.

East Berthing Sidings and Crane Depot

Movements out of the sidings
The Driver of a train from the East Berthing Sidings must ask the Signaller for permission to draw up to Position Light
Signal AD2132 or AD2134. The Driver must operate the “Train Ready to Start” button.

Movements into the Crane depot
The Person in Charge of incoming movements is the only person who is authorised to place the Acceptance Switch in the
‘clear’ position.

Turning the Acceptance Switch to the ‘clear’ position enables the Signaller to clear the signal for the movement into the
Depot. When the inward movement has passed clear of position light signal AD2130, the Acceptance Switch must be
returned to the ‘blocked’ position.

If an incoming movement has to be stopped in emergency after the Acceptance Switch has been turned to the ‘clear’
position, it must be returned to the ‘blocked’ position in addition to carrying out the provisions of the Rule Book.
                                                                                                          Dated: 20/09/08
