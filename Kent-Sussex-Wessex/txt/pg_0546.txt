3.4     KVB train stop override
        3.4.1    If you are authorised to pass a colour light stop signal at DANGER by the issue of the appropriate form,
                 your train must be less than 100 metres from the signal concerned.
        3.4.2    You must :-
                 •        press the BP-FS button before proceeding, not more than 60 seconds before passing the
                          signal, and
                 •        obey any KVB indications, and
                 •        run under “Proceed on Sight” conditions until either:
                          (a)     you reach the next colour light signal, or

4       System failures and procedures
4.1     KVB on-board equipment becoming defective
        4.1.1    You must consider the KVB equipment on your train to be defective if the “panne engine” indication
                 becomes illuminated.
        4.1.2    If a Eurostar train is to enter the Ashford colour light signal controlled area, it must stop before leaving
                 the area controlled by cab signalling. You must agree a suitable location where the train is to stop with
                 the (HS1) signaller.
                 Southeastern trains must not proceed from Ashford towards HS1 with defective KVB.
        4.1.3    When you have stopped, you must:
                 •        consult the traction specific instructions for the type of traction unit concerned, and
                 •        tell the signaller when you are ready to proceed.
        4.1.4    If it becomes necessary to isolate the KVB equipment on your train in order to overcome the defect, you
                 must:
                 •        tell the signaller, and
                 •        not move the train until authorised to do so, and
                 •        carry out the instructions given to you.
        The signaller will authorise you to proceed.
        4.1.5    You will be told of the location of any temporary speed restrictions imposed using lineside signs by the
                 signaller.
4.2     KVB ground equipment becoming defective
        4.2.1    If the “panne sol” indication becomes illuminated, you must tell the signaller as soon as possible that:
                 •        a warning indication has been received that the KVB ground equipment has become defective,
                          and
                 •        the location where the indication was received.
                          (a)         KVB train protection system
5       If the KVB train protection equipment in the driving cab becomes defective during the journey, you must:
                 •        apply the instructions above, and
                 •        consult the traction specific instructions for the type of traction unit concerned, and
                 •        tell the signaller.
