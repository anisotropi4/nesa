COUPLING RESTRICTIONS FOR LOCOMOTIVES
With the exception of the Routes listed in the tables Y and X below, three ‘live’ locomotives (of any permitted class) may
work coupled together. When hauling dead locomotives, up to five locomotives may be coupled together, including the
hauling locomotive(s), without special authority. In addition the following restrictions apply:
ELR       LOR         Route description      Restriction
TBH1      SO520       Billingshurst –        20mph over Bridge 397 Thorndell Viaduct (52m 74ch)
                      Arundel Jn
BML1      SW105       Clapham Jn -           Clapham Jn and Worgret Jn. Five locomotives may work coupled
                      Wimbledon              together between Allbrook and Eastleigh Diesel Depot (via exit roads 1
                                             and 2) and X between Worgret Jn and Weymouth.
SDP2      SW140       Quay Viaduct -         40 mph over Wallington Viaduct (85m 33ch and 85m 44ch between
                      Cosham Jn              Fareham and Portchester) if there is more one locomotive and any of
                                             them conform to RA7 or above.


Table Y details the routes over which :
        Two ‘live’ locomotives may work coupled together. Locomotives that conform to RA7 or above must work singly
         and not coupled to any other locomotive (except in an emergency when it is necessary to do so in order to clear
         the line) and that there are certain restrictions which must be adhered to when it is necessary to haul a ‘dead’
         locomotive.
        One locomotive may haul another locomotive but spacing wagons of a minimum length of 45 feet (14 metres)
         must be marshalled between the two locomotives when one or both locomotives conform to RA7 or above.
