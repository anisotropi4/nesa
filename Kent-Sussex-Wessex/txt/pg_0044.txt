Rule Book Module S5 - Passing a signal at danger
Stop signals located in tunnels
In the case of signals controlling the entrance to tunnels the nearest telephone in working order must be used to obtain the
Signallerâ€™s Instructions. The Driver must have a clear understanding with the Signaller to whom he speaks regarding the
line on which the train is standing and the prefix letters and number or the title of the signal at which it is detained. The
train must not enter the tunnel until permission is given by the Signaller.
The following instructions must be observed in connection with stop signals located in tunnels as set out below:-
1.    A telephone is provided at each signal at a level convenient for use without the Driver alighting from the cab. A
      duplicate telephone is provided at ground level. If the Driver cannot communicate with the Signaller by means of the
      telephone at cab level, they must use the telephone at ground level.
2.    If instructed to pass a signal at danger in accordance with Rule Book Module S5 Part A, the Driver must give one long
      blast on the warning horn, then proceed with extreme caution, at a speed not exceeding 10 m.p.h. prepared to stop
      short of any obstruction and sounding the warning horn frequently.
3.    The train must be brought to a stand at the first signal beyond the tunnel, whatever the aspect displayed by that signal
      and the Driver, or other member of train crew must telephone the Signaller and inform them that the train has arrived
      complete and the line is clear.
4.    With reference to the Rule Book, Module M2, the person carrying out protection in the rear of a disabled train which is
      standing ahead of a signal in the tunnel need not proceed back beyond this signal provided it is at danger and they
      are able to telephone the Signaller from there. Three detonators must be placed on the obstructed line at the signal.
      In these circumstances the Rule Book Module M2, Section 3.1a) is modified and an assisting train may be allowed to
      enter the tunnel. This train may have reached or be approaching the signal in the tunnel before the person carrying
      out protection arrives there and he must be prepared accordingly.
