Examination of broken rails in tunnels
For the purpose of carrying out Rule Book, Module TW1, Section 5.1, the following tables identify those tunnels
that are 800 metres (40 chains) or less in length for which the following procedure must be applied:
The person carrying out the examination must block the affected line as shown in Handbook 8, Handbook 20 and advise
the Signaller that they will be entering the tunnel to examine the line.
Having established that it is safe to pass a train over the break at 5mph, the person carrying out the examination must
establish a position of safety outside of the tunnel before giving up blockage of the affected line as shown in Handbook 8
or Handbook 20. The Signaller must then be advised that one train may be permitted to pass over the affected line.
The defective rail must be re-examined after the passage of each train.
The Signaller will then instruct the Driver that the emergency speed restriction is throughout the length of the tunnel.
