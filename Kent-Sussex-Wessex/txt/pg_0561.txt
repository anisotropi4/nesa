SO500 - VICTORIA TO BRIGHTON
Star Lane Substation

Because of limited sighting of approaching trains in the Star Lane sub-station area persons going to or from Star Lane
sub-station must telephone the Signaller at Three Bridges before crossing the railway to obtain an assurance that it is safe
to do so; a dial telephone is provided adjacent to each line. The down side telephone is adjacent to signal T181 and the
up side telephone is opposite signal T181. When the person requiring to cross the railway asks the Signaller for an
assurance that it is safe to cross they will either be told that they may cross or to ring again after the passage of a train(s).
After the person(s) has crossed the line they need not advise the Signaller that they have done so.
The telephone number for the Three Bridges Signaller is 00 61752.
Note
The Signaller will not block the lines to trains when he gives the assurance that it is safe to cross but he will ensure that
there is sufficient time for the person(s) to cross the lines.
