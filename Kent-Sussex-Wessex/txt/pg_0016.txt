       Section 5 - Communications procedure
       Using GSM-R berth triggered messages and non-verbal acknowledgements to caution Drivers

       It is now authorised to use to caution Drivers via operational safety messages for 4 scenarios using a GSM-R berth-
       triggered broadcast, with the Driver confirming receipt and acknowledging a clear understanding of the broadcast by using
       the GSM-R ‘ST’ acknowledgement button. All GSM-R Fitted Units in the area will receive these Broadcasts. The berth
       triggered safety broadcasts process can be used for live events for the four scenarios listed:
       Poor railhead conditions.
       Animals on the line.
       Defective Emergency Indicators.
       Wheel Impact Load Detector Activations.
       Unusual events (Not Track or Signalling).
       Drivers of services not fitted with version 3.5 software may disregard the GSM-R berth triggered safety broadcast
       for,
       Poor railhead conditions.
       Animals on the line.
       Defective Emergency Indicators.
       Wheel Impact Load Detector Activations.
       Unusual events (Not Track or Signalling).
       The berth trigger broadcasts will be in the following areas
       All Kent & Sussex (South East) Routes
       Methodology
       Signaller records the berth triggered safety broadcast to a set script and stores it on the system.
       Signaller sets up the berth triggered safety broadcast at the appropriate signal berth.
       Signaller will maintain the protecting signal at danger. This is the signal where the Signaller would stop and caution the
       train if the Signaller does not receive the acknowledgement.
       The safety broadcast will be made automatically to each train occupying the designated berth(s).
       The Driver acknowledges that the safety broadcast has been received and that it has been understood by pressing the ST
       Button.
       The protecting signal is maintained at danger until the signaller has received an acknowledgement from the approaching
       train. The acknowledgement will be an ‘Acknowledgement’ (ACK) message from the Driver.
       The protecting signal may be cleared when the Signaller receives the acknowledgement message.
       If the acknowledgement message is not received by the Signaller the protecting signal remains at danger and the Driver
       obeys all signals as normal.
       When the caution message is received and acknowledged by the Driver they will continue to obey all signals and apply the
       appropriate rule over the section of line.
