      Section 2, Clause 2.3 – Disconnecting signalling equipment
      Protection Arrangements
      For the purposes of this procedure a track circuit may be considered as part of the signalling controls.
      Points which can be disconnected, maintained, and detected, in one position which could be used to prevent trains approaching
      may also be considered part of the signalling controls.
      Where reliance is placed on a track circuit showing occupied, a signalling technician disconnecting signalling equipment must
      make sure that the protection is not compromised by the setting of a shunt, call-on or warning class route, nor the approach
      control of main aspects.
