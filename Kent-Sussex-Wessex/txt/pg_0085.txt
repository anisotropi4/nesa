a)    on platform lines at terminal stations,
b)    on dead end bay lines at through stations

Berthing of trains in sidings
At certain locations, in order to reduce the risk of a collision between moving and berthed rolling stock, a safe clearance
point is indicated, where such an indication is not already given by a signal or stop board.
This indication is provided by painting a sleeper in each siding, at the appropriate distance from the points, with yellow
paint.
Stock must not be berthed between the yellow sleeper and the points.
The yellow sleeper has no meaning other than as shown above.
Non-electrified sidings
Electric traction units fitted with collector shoe gear must not be placed in non-electrified sidings except in an emergency
or where prior arrangements have been made. When it is necessary for such a movement to be made, care must first be
taken to see that there is no obstruction on or alongside the siding that will come into contact with the collector shoes. The
movement into the siding must then be made with caution. Before the stock is removed from the siding, staff must ensure
that ramps are provided on the conductor rail, or be prepared to ‘paddle up’ the collector shoes. This does not apply to
single car departmental units (former Class 419 Motor Luggage Vans) or Class 73 locomotives provided all collector shoes
are first raised.
