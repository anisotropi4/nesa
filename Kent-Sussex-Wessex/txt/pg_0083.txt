    â€¢
Permanent Way and S & T Equipment utilising wheels for movement along tracks, such as trolleys and engineering
skates, must not be used without the permission of the COSS/PC/PICOP. Such equipment must not access rails within 5
metres of any axle counter heads.
In connection with Rule Book Module T3 and Rule Book Handbook 11, when giving up a possession the PICOP must
confirm that all axle counter sections within the possession area are clear and safe to run on.
Under certain conditions drivers will be required to undertake examination of the line in connection with the resetting of
axle counter sections and will be requested to report to the signaller at an appointed location to confirm the status of the
line being examined.
