Rule Book Handbook 11 - Duties of the person in charge
of the possession (PICOP)
Section 5, Clause 5.2 – Automatic half barrier crossing (AHBC)
Wessex Route

At the crossings shown below there is a stop signal between the ‘Strike in point’ and the crossing. The ‘strike in’ is
inhibited when the signal is at danger. Therefore if the signal is passed at danger a train can arrive at the crossing without
adequate warning to road users.
Consequently in addition to the requirements of the Handbook 11, Section 5.2 the following AHB crossings must be placed
under local control before any movements are made over the crossings on the line(s) shown. Local control may be given
up when the movement(s) has passed over the crossing.
