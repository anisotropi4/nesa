Multiple Unit trains conveying passengers or running as empty stock are authorised to terminate and start back from the
Up Hounslow platform when this has been planned and published in the relevant operating notice.
Position light signal F433 will be cleared for the start back movement from the Up Hounslow line to the Down Hounslow
line towards F137 signal.
The clearance of position light signal F433 is the authority for the driver to proceed.
Rule Book module S2 section 3 clause 3.1 is modified accordingly for this circumstance.
                                                                                                         Dated: 14/02/2015

Before a shunting movement takes place from the Down line the Driver and Signaller must come to clear understanding as
to the route to be taken.
Starting of Up trains from the Down platform
During an emergency or severe service disruption, Up passenger trains may start from the Down platform. Provided the
Driver can confirm that he can see position light signal F472 it will not be necessary to provide a Handsignaller.
If it is known that this working will be necessary in advance, the train must not be allowed to proceed into the platform until
the Driver has been advised of the circumstances by the Signaller. This will enable the Driver to stop the train in a position
where the signal can be seen from the rear cab.
                                                                                                            Dated: 10/05/14
