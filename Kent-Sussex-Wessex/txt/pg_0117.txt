Lines Equipped with Axle Counters
Before engineering work takes place on a section of line equipped with axle counters, you must check whether or not the
work will affect any axle counter heads.
Activities such as rail grinding, tamping, ballast cleaning, stoneblowing etc., can damage track-mounted equipment. Where
necessary a Signalling technician must be arranged to disconnect / remove / replace the axle counter equipment.
Hand and motorised trolleys, also any vehicle being moved on wheel skates, must not be allowed to enter a section of line
controlled by axle counters unless arrangements have been made to reset the equipment. Road/rail vehicles must not be
on- or off- tracked within 2 metres of an axle counter head.
