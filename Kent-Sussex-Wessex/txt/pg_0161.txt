RAILWAY CRIME
All railway staff must be vigilant to railway crime and cable theft, and report any suspicious activity on the operational
railway, or in the area of electrical substations, to the controlling signaller.
Some examples of suspicious activity could be:
•   Anyone not wearing appropriate PPE, or that do not appear to have a safe system of work.
•   Anyone not responding to a train drivers warning, or appearing to hide as trains or people approach.
•   Vehicles that do not have any company markings or logos
•   Signalling location cabinets with doors open or missing, or troughing lids newly disturbed, with no staff nearby.
•   People ‘loitering’ in the area of electrical substations.
In such cases, please inform the controlling signaller as quickly as possible giving precise location details. Drivers do not
need to stop their trains immediately to report this, unless they consider it a safety of the line issue.
                                                                                            National GI - Dated: 30/08/14
