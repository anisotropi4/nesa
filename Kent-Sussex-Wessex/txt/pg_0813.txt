Use of Staff Protection Lock-Out Device (PLOD) in connection with Handbook 8 and Handbook 21
A Protection Lock-Out Device (PLOD) is provided for the sections of line shown in the table below. When the PLOD is
operated, train movements over the section of line concerned are stopped and locked out by the signalling system.
The PLOD key/switch must be considered to be a “single line staff or token” for the purposes of applying this procedure
(as shown in Handbook 8 – section 2.5 and Handbook 21).
The SWL/COSS/IWA must agree with the signaller, which line will be affected and carry out the necessary arrangements
to operate the Staff Protection Lock Out Device for the section concerned before the protection is granted.
