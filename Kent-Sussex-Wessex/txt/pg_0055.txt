Section 2.4 - Using a track circuit operating device
Kent/Sussex Routes

The use of an approved Track Circuit Operating Device (T-COD) is authorised throughout Network Rail Kent and Sussex
Routes subject to the general conditions below and as shown in the following tables.
Pre-installed, remote controlled T-CODs (RC T-CODs) e.g. ZKLs are authorised where specified in the table below.
Note:      If a section of route or location is not shown in the left-hand column, T-CODs must not be used.
Track Circuit Operating Devices: -
•      may only be used by a person trained and certified competent in the use of the T-COD to be applied.
•      may only be used in areas where signals are controlled and maintained to danger by the operation of track circuits.
       (Examples of exclusions include Semaphore signals and some colour light signals in AB areas)
•      must not be used on a track circuit affected by track circuit failures, broken rail or negative bonding defects or repairs.
•      must not be used on the approach to an MCB-OD, AHB ABCL or AOCL crossing if it would affect the crossing
       controls
•      must not be applied between the signal protecting a CCTV or MCB crossing and the level crossing.
•      must not be applied in “fourth” rail electrified areas.
•      must not be applied where check or guard rails exist.
•      must not be applied where Yellow conductor rail shrouding is fitted.
Cautionary Notes:
•      Applying a T-COD near points may inhibit the use of some signalled routes which were not affected by the work.
•      Applying a T-COD on a section of line that becomes part of an overlap track circuit may inhibit the use of some
       signalled routes which were not affected by the work.
•      Applying a T-COD in an area where TOWS is fitted will prompt a continuous warning from the TOWS equipment.
•      Applying T-CODs to track circuits that control Tokenless Block sections may cause the block to fail.
If the application of a T-COD would actuate the annunciator for a level crossing, this must first be disconnected by the
Technician.
