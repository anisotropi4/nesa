Cautionary Notes:
•      Applying a T-COD near points may inhibit the use of some signalled routes which are not affected by the work
•      Applying a T-COD on a section of line that becomes part of an overlap track circuit may inhibit the use of some
       signalled routes which are not affected by the work
•      Applying a T-COD in an area where TOWS is fitted will prompt a continuous warning from the TOWS warning
       equipment
