       SW105 - CLAPHAM JUNCTION TO WEYMOUTH
       WIMBLEDON STAFF HALT

       Staff using this halt must travel by only those trains shown in the Working Timetables to stop, or specially authorised by
       Network Rail Control at Waterloo, and must ensure that the train will run on the Up Fast line after leaving Wimbledon. If
       the train has to be diverted to the Up Slow line no stop will be made.
       Trains calling must stop with the leading cab at the London end of the platform and staff wishing to alight must travel in the
       front two compartments of the leading coach.
       Platform staff are not provided and the 'ready to start' signal will not be given by the Guard. Staff alighting from or joining
       trains must ensure that doors are properly closed as an indication to the Driver that the train may proceed.
       Trains formed of Class 158/159/170/455 or 458 stock
       On departure from Wimbledon, staff wishing to alight at the staff halt must travel in the Vestibule behind the leading driving
       cab. On arrival at the staff halt, staff must only join and alight through the local crew access door. This door must be
       operated by the Driver.
       Trains formed of class 444 or 450 stock.
       On departure from Wimbledon, staff wishing to alight at the staff halt must travel in the passenger accommodation
       immediately behind the leading driving cab. On arrival at the staff halt where a Guard is provided, the Guard must open
       the leading set of ‘passenger doors’, (immediately behind the Driver) under local control. Staff must only join and alight
       from this door. When it is safe to do so, the Guard must close the door and give the ‘ready to start’ signal to the Driver.
       Where a train is Driver only operated (ECS), staff wishing to join or alight will only be able to do so via the drivers cab
       door.
       Empty trains
       Drivers of all empty trains requiring to set back into the depot from position light signal 1107 at the Staff Halt on the Up
       Fast line must immediately telephone the Signaller if signal W158 is at danger.
       Class 458 units
       Movements formed of Class 458 units into Wimbledon depot must be made via the Up Slow line at Wimbledon station and
       then via 725 points to No.1 Up siding. Drivers of such trains must inform
       the Signaller of the formation when approaching Wimbledon station.
