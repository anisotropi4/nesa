       Detention of trains on running lines - use of Signal Post Telephones

       Certain signals are provided with a reflective sign which indicates to Drivers that they should alight from the right hand side
       of the driving cab to use the signal post telephone. The sign illustrates a Driver climbing down the back of a telephone
       handset, with a blue arrow below pointing to the right. The signs will normally be positioned adjacent to the signal prefix
       number plate, at signals where the telephone is located to the right of the line, to which the signal refers.
