       The following instruction applies to the Ashford North Kent 1 Signaller when they have a train departing the
       Elizabeth Line to North Kent Line at Alsike Road Junction.

       When ready, all trains must operate the Train Ready to Start (TRTS) at NK501 to depart the Elizabeth line
       Engineering Road to join the Down North Kent towards Slade Green.


       The following instruction applies to the Ashford North Kent 1 Signaller when they have a RFLI OTM at a stand at NK120
       required to enter the Elizabeth line.

       At NK120 the OTM Driver will contact the North Kent 1 Signaller to confirm the vehicle is ready to depart from

       Movement of OTMs between Elizabeth line Abbey Wood and North Kent Line
       The movement of OTMs over the North Kent Line boundary will be an infrequent occurrence. To facilitate movement of
       Rail for London Infrastructure OTMs over the Network Rail North Kent Line boundary a Crossrail Central Operating
       Section and Network Rail Sectional Appendix Local Instruction is required to be published.


       When an OTM is required to leave the Elizabeth line via the Engineering Road towards Slade Green, the OTM Driver must
       stop at NK501 to isolate the Communications-Based Train Control (CBTC) system. When the OTM Driver is ready to
       proceed, the OTM Driver will operate the Train Ready to Start (TRTS) at NK501.


       When a OTM is returning to the Elizabeth line from the North Kent Line the OTM Driver will stop at NK120 to reinstate the
       CBTC. When ready to proceed to the Elizabeth Line, the OTM Driver will contact the North Kent Line 1 Signaller. The
       North Kent Line Signaller will set the route to the Elizabeth line Engineering Road when advised by the OTM Driver that
       the OTM is ready to depart
