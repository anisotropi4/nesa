Trial using GSM-R to advise drivers of speed restrictions relating to Track Defects and Bridge Strikes between
23/06/2019 and 23/12/2019.
A trial is taking place to test additional scenarios for GSM-R Safety Broadcasts to pass safety critical information to Drivers
with the Driver confirming receipt and acknowledging understanding by using the ‘acknowledgement’ button.
The trial involves TOC/FOC services only and will be for Track Defects and Bridge Strikes
The trial will be limited to the following areas only:
Oxted Signal Box – Upper Warlingham East Grinstead/Uckfield.
Three Bridges ROC – Lewisham to Hayes
& East Kent Signalling Centre - complete area.
Methodology
1.   Signaller identifies the requirement to caution
2.   Signaller decides whether cautioning using GSM-R is possible and the signals where the berth broadcast is to be
     triggered (these may be predefined for some trial scenarios covering static locations e.g. Bridges)
3.   Signaller records the caution message to a set script and stores it on the system (unless pre-recorded message
     exists)
4.   The message content shall contain full words and no abbreviations.
5.   The message shall be recorded to the set scripts using the ‘Safety’ identifier.
6.   The message shall make it clear that the message is complete.
7.   The berth triggered broadcast will be active for a period of four hours and will need to be reset or a new message
     recorded to supersede it.
8.   Only one berth broadcast can be recorded per signaller but the message can be triggered at separate signal berths
     on several lines.
9.   Signaller sets up the berth triggered broadcast at the correct signal berth(s).
10. Signaller will maintain the protecting signal at danger with a reminder appliance applied. This is the signal where the
    Signaller would stop and caution the train under current conditions.
