West Crossings

Run-round movements
If it is necessary for a train to be propelled to signal W49, W57 or W59 at West Crossings in order to run the locomotive
round the train, the Guard or Shunter will be advised by the Signaller:-
a) which line the train will use for the run-round movement;
b)   which line will be blocked for protection of the Guard or Shunter whilst uncoupling and coupling the locomotive.
The Guard or Shunter must obtain an assurance from the Signaller that the line has been blocked. Uncoupling and
coupling of the locomotive must be carried out on the side of the train next to the blocked line.
