Temporary Isolation Process
1.      If a Temporary Isolation is required to be taken in order to carry out unplanned local activities on or near the
conductor rail in order to contain an incident and/or make the railway safe for operation, the process described in the
document must be used as a basis for planning the Temporary Isolation.
2.       After a request for a Temporary Isolation has been received by Control, a brief Risk Assessment Conference
shall be arranged on the telephone. The mandatory attendees shall be the Network Delivery Manager (NDM) and the
Requester. The conference shall discuss the options to agree if a Temporary Isolation is the best option. For example, if
the work requires electrical sections to be isolated on multiple lines or is in a place where the isolation is complicated, the
best option may be to use a T3 Possession and a ‘B’ form traction current isolation.
3.       If it is agreed that a Temporary Isolation is the most appropriate option, the NDM shall nominate an Incident
Controller to organise arrangements for the Temporary Isolation.
4.         The Incident Controller shall liaise with the Temporary Isolation Requester and obtain the details required by the
first section (labelled ‘Control’) of the Temporary Isolation Record of Arrangements form. The Incident Controller shall
input ‘Draft A’ into the ‘Issue No’ box.
5.       The Incident Controller shall distribute the Temporary Isolation Record of Arrangements form to the relevant
ECR, the relevant signal box(es) and the Temporary Isolation Requester for completion (by email primarily – or other
means if not available).
6.       The ECO shall liaise with the Signaller/SSM to agree blocking points to protect the Temporary Isolation. The
ECO shall complete the section marked ‘ECR’ on the Temporary Isolation Record of Arrangements form as far as is
possible and send the form back to the Incident Controller.
7.       The Temporary Isolation Requester and the Signaller/SSM shall liaise to complete the section marked
‘Requester’ on the Temporary Isolation Record of Arrangements form as far as is possible. The form shall then be sent
back to the Incident Controller.
8.      The Incident Controller shall collate the responses and compile a first final draft, labelled ‘Draft B’, sending it to
the ECO, Signaller/SSM, and Requester.
9.        All parties must check the Temporary Isolation Record of Arrangements form and check that all details are
correct. If an error is found it must be brought to the attention of the Incident Controller immediately.
10.      The ECO, Signaller/SSM, Requester shall all individually come to agreement and convey this to the Incident
Controller. If any changes are to be made, the Incident Controller will create another document and annotate as issue 2,
issue 3, and so on. This will continue until all parties agree.
