       Rule Book Module P2 - Working single and bi-directional
       lines by pilotman
       Section 1 - Circumstances
       Wessex Route
       If there is a failure of a track circuit or signal on the lines shown below and the Signaller is able to obtain a ‘direction of
       traffic flow’ indication for the direction required, Working by Pilotman need not be introduced but the Signaller must tell the
       Driver about the circumstances and instruct the Driver to pass the signal at danger and, if necessary, to proceed at caution
       over the affected portion of the line.
       If Working by Pilotman has been introduced it must not be withdrawn until the failure has been rectified, or the train service
       withdrawn. If it is necessary to run trains after the withdrawal of Working by Pilotman, and the original fault still exists,
       then Working by Pilotman must be re-introduced for every train.
       The Rule Book, Module P2, Section1 ‘Working of single lines by Pilotman is modified accordingly.
