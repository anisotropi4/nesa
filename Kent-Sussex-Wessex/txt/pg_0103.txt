Fires on clamplock points
If a fire is discovered affecting a set of hydraulically operated points, the following must be noted:-
•   Excessive hydraulic fluid can be discharged under pressure if the points are operated, so fuelling the fire and
    endangering the safety of the staff;
•   The locking of the points can be affected by the fire damage
When a fire on a set of clamplock points is reported or discovered which has or may cause damage to the hydraulic pump
unit and/or associated hydraulic pipes, the points must not be operated. A reminder appliance must be placed on the
lever/switch, (on a route setting panel the individual points switch must be operated to the normal or reverse position, as
appropriate) to ensure that premature operation of points cannot be inadvertently initiated. Before any movement of trains
in the facing direction is made the points are to be clipped and padlocked in the required position. If the point detection is
maintained after the points have been secured then trains may be signalled in the normal manner. The Signaller must not
remove a reminder appliance and move a set of clamplock points until they have been assured by the IMC that the fire
has been extinguished and it is safe to do so.
