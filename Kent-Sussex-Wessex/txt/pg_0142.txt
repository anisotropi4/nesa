       Lines Equipped with Axle Counters
       Before engineering work takes place on a section of line equipped with axle counters, you must check whether or not the
       work will affect any axle counter heads.
       Activities such as rail grinding, tamping, ballast cleaning, stoneblowing etc., can damage track-mounted equipment. Where
       necessary a Signalling technician must be arranged to disconnect / remove / replace the axle counter equipment.
       Hand and motorised trolleys, also any vehicle being moved on wheel skates, must not be allowed to enter a section of line
       controlled by axle counters unless arrangements have been made to reset the equipment. Road/rail vehicles must not be
       on- or off- tracked within 2 metres of an axle counter head.
