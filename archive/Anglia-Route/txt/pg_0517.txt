Failure of Level Crossings
If there is a complete failure of lights at a level crossing and the Driver's view of the public highway becomes restricted, the
Conductor must:
•   Alight from the train to establish whether the highway is clear.
•   When it is established that the highway is clear the Conductor must signal to the Driver of his train that it is safe to
    move over and clear of the crossing.
