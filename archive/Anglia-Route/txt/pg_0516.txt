EA1390 - BARKING TILBURY LINE JN EAST TO PITSEA JN (VIA
TILBURY)
Tilbury Riverside International Rail Freight Terminal

All movements within the Tilbury Riverside International Railfreight terminal are controlled by the Rail Terminal Operator
(RTO).
The RTO will normally be advised by the Signaller at Upminster I.E.C.C. of the train’s expected arrival when it is at UR601
Signal. On receiving this advice, the RTO will check that all conditions are met for the train to be accepted safely into the
terminal and then open and secure the rail security gates.
When this has been completed, the RTO will press the Acceptance button.
If, after the Acceptance button has been pressed, it is necessary in an emergency to stop an incoming train from entering
the sidings, the RTO must:
•   Operate the cancel button and
•   Take any other necessary action so as to stop the train and
•   Inform the Signaller.
The RTO will advise the Signaller when a train is ready to leave the terminal along with its identity and destination.
