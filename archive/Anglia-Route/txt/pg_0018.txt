Rule Book Module TW7 - Wrong-direction movements
Section 1, Clause 1.1 – Authority for a wrong-direction movement
Station overruns in the area controlled by Liverpool Street IECC

Friday (between the hours of 0600 and 2100) for services booked to call at stations between the following locations:
    •    Broxbourne and London Liverpool Street Station via the Lea Valley and Southbury Loop via Seven Sisters
     •   Witham/Southend Victoria and London Liverpool Street Station
In the event of a station overrun within these areas and times listed above the following instructions are to be followed;
    •    the Driver and Signaller must always ensure a clear understanding is reached.
    •    the Signaller must advise Control of all station overrun incidents.

Handbook 8/21& Rule Book Module TS1, Regulation 13.2
– IWA, COSS, PC or SWL blocking a line
Planning and Protection Arrangements
On all lines listed within the Anglia Route Sectional Appendix – line blockages must be planned so as to limit the extent of
the blockage to affect no more than two signalboxes at a time. If, due to exceptional circumstances, it becomes necessary
to plan a blockage which affects more than two signalbox areas then the authority of the Network Rail Operations
Manager or his nominated deputy must be obtained.
Handbook 8, Section 2, Clause 2.3 – Disconnecting signalling equipment
Protection arrangements
For the purposes of this procedure a track circuit may be considered as part of the signalling controls. Points which can be
disconnected, maintained, and detected, in one position which could be used to prevent trains approaching may also be
considered part of the signalling controls.
Where reliance is placed on the occupancy of a track circuit, signal technicians shall satisfy themselves that the protection
is not compromised by the setting of shunt, call-on or warner class routes nor the approach control of main aspects.
