CCTV and AHBC attendants instructions
Historically, Level Crossing Instructions for a person appointed to take local control have been posted at each Level
Crossing. However, accommodation for the attendant is not always provided and this has resulted in inconsistency in the
distribution arrangements for these instructions.
Attendants instructions for all CCTV and AHBC level crossings within Anglia Route are now published on the Network Rail
Internal Portal Knowledge Hub (under Anglia-Route, Operations: References) and will no longer be posted at Level Crossings. It
is the responsibility of the Attendant to obtain copies of the instructions for those level crossings for which they are
competent. In the event of any difficulty, please speak to your line manager.
Non-Network Rail staff must obtain copies via their Network Rail contact.
