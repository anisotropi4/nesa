Electric locomotive-operated trains
From 06.30 to 08.30 hours and from 17.20 to 19.30 hours Mondays to Fridays, all electric locomotive-operated trains must
be worked only by one locomotive.
Any additional locomotive must have the pantograph lowered before running between the above-mentioned locations.
This restriction is due to power supply limitations.

Ingatestone WILD
Wheel impact load detector (WILD) equipment is installed on both lines at 24m 79ch (approximately 150 metres on the
country side of Church Lane level crossing).
The purpose of this equipment is to minimise the possibility of damage to track caused by wheel defects or overloaded
vehicles and to provide details of all trains with wheel loads outside acceptable limits.
It measures train / vehicle wheel loads and impact forces and is programmed to alert Anglia Route Control when Alarm
levels are generated.
The Network Rail Train Running Controller (Freight) must action the alarms generated by advising the Signaller(s)
concerned that trains are to be brought to a stand using the normal signal sequence and further action will depend upon
the level of alarm generated.
                                                                                                            Dated: 29/07/18

WITHAM
Working over No. 4 Platform Line
At Witham Station, Platform 4, a double sided marker board capable of displaying the illuminated words “STOP HERE” is
provided to facilitate the coupling of a 4-car train at the London end of the platform and an 8-car train at the country end of
the platform.
Drivers of 4 car trains arriving from the London direction and Drivers of 8 car trains arriving from the Braintree direction
must be prepared to stop at this board if the words “STOP HERE” are illuminated. Otherwise, they must stop at the normal
train stop marker.
After stopping at the “STOP HERE” board, a Driver must not move towards the signal ahead until either the signal is
cleared or he is personally instructed to do so by the person in charge of the platform, even though the words “STOP
HERE” may have ceased to be illuminated.
                                                                                                            Dated: 05/08/06
