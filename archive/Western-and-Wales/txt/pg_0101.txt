INFRASTRUCTURE MONITORING TRAINS
Network Rail own a fleet of specially adapted Infrastructure Monitoring vehicles which operate frequently on
most Network Rail routes, these vehicles are painted yellow and carry Network Rail logos. Trains with these
vehicles in them generally operate with a ‘Q’ headcode so as to denote that they are line specific.

During movements, these vehicles can emit a powerful underframe light source which could be mistakenly
identified as a binding brake or sparks being emitted from the bogies, and as such, does not require to be
reported to the controlling Signaller. However, if in any doubt, then normal operating procedures should be
applied.
