GW103 - PADDINGTON TO UFFINGTON
MAIDENHEAD
Maidenhead Loop Line. Drivers of down through trains entering an unoccupied platform must bring their trains to a stand
at the train marker board at the Marlow end of the platform. Up through trains should be brought to a stand at the train
marker board at the London end of the platform.
Drivers of terminating down or up trains entering an unoccupied platform line must bring their trains to a stand at the
intermediate train marker board.
A second train is permitted to enter the bay platform line from either direction in accordance with the Rule Book, Module
TW1, Section 20.
The driver of a train which has come to a stand in the platform must make no further movement unless authorised to do so
by the signaller or the appropriate platform starting signal has been cleared for the train to proceed.
Handling of token. The driver must operate the token instrument personally, except as shown below.
When on duty, the PiC of the platform must operate the token instrument for through passenger trains. For down through
trains, the PiC must normally obtain the token from the instrument just prior to the trainâ€™s arrival then hand the token to the
driver. For up through trains, the token must be collected from the driver immediately on arrival then put in the instrument.
If the PiC of the platform is not available to deal with a through train, the driver must operate the token instrument. When
possible the driver will be informed in advance of the need to do this.
Down Main Platform. Access to the signal post telephone associated with Signal T573 is via a locked gate which is
opened by a BR mark 1 key.
