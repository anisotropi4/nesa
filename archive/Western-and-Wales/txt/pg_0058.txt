Western Route Sectional Appendix Module WR1




Worcester Shrub Hill - semaphore signals
Two disc shaped signals, one above the other, are provided under the station canopy approximately midway along the
Down Platform line. The larger (upper) signal is the Down Main starting signal and must be treated as a semaphore
main stop arm as described in section 3.2 of Handbook RS/521.
The smaller (lower) signal is the Down Main calling-on signal and must be regarded as a semaphore subsidiary calling-
on arm as described in section 3.4 of Handbook RS/521.


Semaphore shunting signals that display a white light
Certain semaphore shunting signals on Western and Wales Routes show a white light when the signal is in the ‘Normal’
position, which means stop. However, provided the Signaller has given authority, the Driver may pass a signal in the
‘Normal’ position if it cannot be cleared to the ‘Proceed’ position for the route the movement is to take.


Points Indicators
At certain remote crossing loops on Western and Wales Route lines controlled by the NSTR system, points indicators
show two white lights at an angle of 45˚ (i.e. similar to a position light signal when cleared) to indicate when the points are
correctly set. Section 5.6 of Handbook RS/521 is modified accordingly. See also NSTR Regulations published separately.
