Shunting movements to the up siding. For shunting movements into the up siding, drivers are authorised to pass the “start
of token section” board without the forward section token. The competent person in charge (PiC) must obtain permission
from the signaller at Pantyffynnon to operate the ground frame and assure the signaller that the points have been reversed
before any movement is authorised.
In order to avoid unnecessary TPWS interventions, it is not permitted to make simultaneous movements into the up siding
and from the Down Loop line in the up direction (i.e., other than the usual departure direction).
The PiC must advise the signaller when the movement to the up siding is completed. NSTR regulations 3.9 and 3.11.3
are amended accordingly.
