Signaller will give permission to the COSS/PC to activate the RTCOD and observe the following track circuits DA on the
Down Main or BG on the Up Main, to confirm it activates prior to issuing the associated authority number. Once the work
has been completed, the signaller must observe the track circuit so that normal indications are obtained

applied:
The Signaller will report the Track Circuit as a fault in the normal manner.
