       Running lines & speed restrictions column
       This contains a diagrammatic representation of all running lines and associated connection, but is not to scale. Lines are
       displayed as follows:

       Speed Restrictions
         • The maximum permissible speed is shown in miles per hour on each running line.
         • The location of a change in maximum permissible speed is indicated by a star.
         •  The mileage at which the speed change occurs is shown in the mileage column, along with a further star.
       On bi-directional lines a star may indicate a change in speed in one direction only. This will be indicated by an arrow next
       to the star and the speed to which it applies (see diagrammatic explanation of symbols table).
       Where a differential speed restriction applies, it is indicated as in the following example:
