National exceptions to MU trains
• Class 185 trains are not permitted to run at MU or DMU speeds
• Class 390 trains are not permitted to run at MU or EMU speeds
• Class 253 and 254 trains formed with less than three coaches between the power cars are not permitted to run at MU
    or DMU speeds

Rule Book Module SP Section 3 – Temporary Speed
Restriction (TSR)
Trial introducing a new sign similar in its appearance and specification to the existing ‘T’ indicator but bearing the
letter ‘A’ meaning ‘accelerate’ located underneath the ‘T’ indicator for the temporary speed restriction.
During the trial the Driver will be able to accelerate when the front of the train reaches the ‘A’ and ‘T’ indicators. Where the
‘A’ indicator is not visible the Driver will comply with Rule Book module SP and accelerate when the rear of the train
passes the ‘T’ indicator.
During the trial the ‘A’ indicator may be removed and the trial suspended if:
• • an ESR is imposed over the same section of line,
• • where there is a consecutive TSR after the trial location or
• • where a complex TSR is introduced.
The trial involves the following level crossings:

Rule Book Module SP - Speeds : Emergency speed
restriction
Section 4 - Emergency Speed restrictions (ESR) - How emergency speed restrictions
are set up
If an emergency speed restriction (ESR) is imposed and before the speed restriction equipment has been set up, the
signaller will tell the driver of a train to pass over the ESR the actual speed limit that has been imposed by the engineer.
It will no longer be necessary for the drivers of all trains to proceed at no more than 20 mph prior to the erection of the
speed restriction equipment but drivers must travel over the restriction at no more than the speed given by the signaller.
This also means that only trains which would normally be running at a speed higher than the ESR to be imposed will need
to be cautioned by the signaller. For example, if an ESR of 60 mph is imposed, it will not be necessary to stop and advise
the drivers of trains classes 6, 7 or 8.
