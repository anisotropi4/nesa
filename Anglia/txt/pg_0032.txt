Electric traction operation during strong winds and high
air temperatures
Strong Winds
In the event of strong winds it may become necessary to impose speed restrictions applicable to electric traction
movements. The Electrification Engineer employed by the appropriate Infrastructure Maintainer is responsible for initiating
the imposition of speed restrictions to reduce the risk of damage to OHLE and electric trains. The Electrification Engineer
will advise the appropriate Route Manager over which routes the restrictions will be enforced as indicated in the table
below.
On notification of adverse conditions which may affect electric traction movements (via the weather forecast or via
information from customers, contractors or Network Rail staff) Route Managers must liaise with the Electrification Engineer
employed by the appropriate Infrastructure Maintainer and Romford Electrical Control Office as to the need to impose a
restriction(s). The final decision will be made by the Electrification Engineer employed by the appropriate Infrastructure
Maintainer.

The Route Manager will arrange to advise all Train Operators, who will ensure that all Drivers are aware of the speed
restriction to be observed.
High air temperatures
In the event of high air temperatures, it will become necessary at specific times during the day to impose speed
restrictions on certain lines along the GE Main line on the Anglia route, to reduce the risk of damage to OHLE and electric
trains, as detailed in the table below. The action necessary to impose these speed restrictions will be initiated by either a
forecast of high air temperatures supplied to the Route Control Manager by the Meteorological Office, or by
measurements taken from temperature sensors situated at strategic points along the GE Main Line on the Anglia Route at
Romford and Stowmarket.

The Route Control Manager will arrange to advise all Train Operators if blanket ESRs are to be introduced across part of
the route by no later than 21:00 the day before the ESR will commence.
The Route Control Manager will arrange to advise all Train Operators if blanket ESRs are to be introduced across the
