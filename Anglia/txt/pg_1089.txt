       EA1520 - SAXMUNDHAM JN TO SIZEWELL
       Working of the single line between Saxmundham Junction and Sizewell Sidings
       The single line section between Saxmundham Junction and Sizewell Sidings is worked in accordance with Module TW1,
       Section 32 ‘Single lines worked with a token or with or without a train staff’ as modified below:
       The train staff for the single line section must be kept either in the signal box at Saxmundham or in the designated locked
       cabinet at Sizewell Sidings (the cabinet at Sizewell Sidings can be opened with a driver’s No.1 key).
       The train staff consists of:
       • the train staff itself (inscribed: ‘Saxmundham Junction/Sizewell – Train Staff’)
       • two detachable segments (inscribed either: ‘Saxmundham Junction/Sizewell – Segment 1 of 2 and train staff’ or
         ‘Saxmundham Junction/Sizewell – Segment 2 of 2 and train staff’)
       A segment of the train staff must be detached and used when the next train is required to pass through the single line
       section in the same direction.
       The train staff (and any remaining segments) must be used when the next train is required to pass through the single line
       section in the opposite direction.
       A segment of the train staff may only be used when the train staff itself is present at that end of the single line section.
       The signaller at Saxmundham must determine whether the train staff or a segment of the train staff is to be conveyed by
       the driver, to make sure that the train staff itself is at the appropriate end of the single line section for the next planned
       train movement.
       Use of a divisible train staff enables up to three trains to pass through the single line section in the same direction when
       the following procedure is applied:
       Down direction train movements from Saxmundham Junction to Sizewell Sidings – Obtaining and delivering the
       train staff (or segment)
       The driver will receive the train staff (or segment) from the signaller at Saxmundham and obtain permission to enter the
       single line section.
       The driver must make sure the train staff itself is present at Saxmundham, when receiving a segment of the train staff
       only.
       When the train has arrived, complete with tail lamp and is clear of the ‘end of token section’ board at Sizewell Sidings, the
       driver must:
       • unlock the designated cabinet and place the train staff (or segment) inside
       • attach the train staff (or segment) to any segment(s) already in the cabinet
       • close and re-lock the cabinet
       • tell the signaller at Saxmundham that the train has arrived, complete with tail lamp and is clear of the ‘end of token
         section’ board at Sizewell Sidings and the train staff (or segment) has been delivered to the cabinet
       Up direction train movements from Sizewell Sidings to Saxmundham Junction – Obtaining and delivering the
       train staff (or segment)
       When a train is ready to depart from Sizewell Sidings, the driver must contact the signaller at Saxmundham and request:
       • permission to obtain the train staff (or segment)
       • permission to enter the single line section
       When the signaller at Saxmundham gives the driver permission to obtain the train staff itself, the driver must:
       • unlock the designated cabinet
       • obtain the train staff
       • close and re-lock the cabinet
       When the signaller at Saxmundham gives the driver permission to obtain a segment of the train staff only, the driver must:
       • unlock the designated cabinet
       • make sure the train staff is present
       • detach a segment from the train staff
       • confirm to the signaller which segment is being detached
       • return the train staff (and any remaining segment) to the cabinet
       • close and re-lock the cabinet
       When the train has arrived, complete with tail lamp and is clear of the ‘end of token section’ board at Saxmundham
       Junction, the driver must deliver the train staff (or segment) to the signaller at Saxmundham.
