       Manual Power Changeover Sites (MPCO) for Multi-Mode trains

       As part of the introduction of Class 755 traction lineside signage has been installed at publicised
       strategic locations across the Anglia route. This signage is a prompt to the driver to either raise or
       lower the pantograph, changing between diesel and electric traction modes as appropriate at up to
       permissible line speed at that location.

       The following signs have been provided at the MPCO zones consisting of 3 signs. Signage is
       currently only applicable to Class 755 traction. Any arrangements for coasting and associated
       Pantograph raising are to be treated separately from these instructions and signs.

       Drivers must adhere to their own specific company operating instructions.

                                 Advance Traction Changeover Sign

                                 As the train passes the ‘advance traction
                                 changeover’ sign the driver must prepare to
                                 carry out a dynamic manual changeover (D>E)
                                 - this must NOT be done before the front of the
                                 train reaches the ‘raise pantograph’ sign.


                                 Raise Pantograph Sign

                                 The driver must wait until the front of the train
                                 has reached this sign before initiating a
                                 dynamic manual changeover (D>E)




                                 Do NOT Raise Pantograph Sign

                                 If the pantograph(s) has not been raised by the
                                 time the front of the train reaches this sign there
                                 must be no attempt made to raise the
                                 pantograph(s) / select Electric Mode when
                                 speed is in excess of 20mph. The train must
                                 continue in Diesel Mode until the train is
                                 stopped or speed is reduced to 20mph or less.
