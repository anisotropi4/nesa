       EA1280 – STRATFORD CENTRAL JN TO COPPERMILL JN
       Stratford Station Up Temple Mills Platform 11

       Stratford Signal S901 – Down Direction
       In association with the extension of Platform 11 at Stratford S901 Signal has been relocated approximately 72 metres (78
       yards) towards the country end. S901 Signal is currently located at the London End of the HS1 overbridge and will be
       moved beyond the same structure.
       The neutral section located at 4m 14ch will remain in its current position until relocated at later date. In the meantime,
       drivers of electric locomotive hauled and EMU trains should be aware that the new distance between S901 Signal and the
       existing neutral section has been reduced by approximately 72 metres (78 yards).
       If you are detained at S901 Signal at danger the proximity of the neutral section should be taken into account when
       bringing your train to a stand, stopping further from the signal than would normally be the case if deemed necessary.
       This is a temporary Local Instruction until the neutral section has been relocated and commissioned.
                                                         Dated: 30/08/2022
