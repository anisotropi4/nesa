Ipswich Upper Yard

Working of Upper Yard
The person in charge of a movement into this yard must ensure that all the hand points are correctly set for the safety of
the train. When the train has been brought to a stand and no further movements are required to be made, the Signaller
must be advised accordingly. If it is necessary for any further movements to be made after this assurance has been given,
then the Signallerâ€™s permission must first be obtained.
Working between Lower and Upper Yards
1. Freight trains in either direction between the Lower and Upper Yards must not exceed 864 metres (945 yards). When
   working other than a fully fitted train from the Upper to the Lower Yard, the person in charge must apply the hand
   brake sufficiently to keep the couplings tight.
2.   Trains must approach Ranelagh Road level crossing with caution.
                                                                                                        Dated: 05/08/06
