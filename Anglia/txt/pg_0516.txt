Failed trains able to contact the signaller

If a train is declared a failure and the driver is able to contact the signaller, the following procedure will apply.
If the signaller establishes that a train has not moved and is able to establish contact with the train, the ELL Failed Train
Procedure will apply.
The Rule Book, Module M2, is modified by the following instruction:
•   The driver of the assisting train will when required be authorised to enter the tunnel section without picking up the driver of
    the failed train,
•   The driver of the assisting train will not arrive at the assistance protection (not carried out),
•   The driver of the assisting train must travel at no more than 3mph whilst proceeding beyond the final signal/station location
    protecting the failed train,
•   The driver of the assisting train must stop 10m from the failed train, and
•   Once stopped 10m from the failed train, the driver of the assisting train must contact the signaller who will initiate a 3-way
    call via the GSM-R radio to arrange the coupling process.

Failed trains unable to contact the signaller
If a train is declared a failure and the driver is unable to contact the signaller, the following procedure will apply.
If the driver of the failed train is unable to contact the signaller after three (3) attempts, they shall consider their train a failure
and make their way to the rear driving cab of the failed train and await the arrival of an assisting train.
If the signaller establishes that a train has not moved and cannot establish contact with the train, the ELL Tunnel Rescue
Procedure will apply.
The Rule Book, Module TS1, Section 21 is superseded by the following instruction:
•    Having failed to communicate with the signaller after 3 attempts, the driver of the failed train will make their way to the rear
     of their train and await the arrival of the assisting train,
•    Once stopped 10m from the failed train the driver of the assisting train will exhibit their hazard warning lights indicating that
     they are ready to couple,
•    The driver of the failed train (who is in the rear cab) will when ready authorise the driver of the assisting train to couple to
     the failed train by exhibiting their hazard warning lights,
•    Confirmation of successful coupling will take place via the cab to cab facility, and
•    Train movements will then continue in the normal direction subject to signal clearance as far as the next station where
     communication with the signaller must take place.
