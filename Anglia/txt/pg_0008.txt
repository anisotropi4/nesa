Trial using GSM-R to advise drivers of speed restrictions due to Critical Rail Temperature (CRT) (heat related
speed) Sites and Underline Bridge Strikes between 23/06/19 to 23/12/19.
A six-month trial is taking place for additional scenarios for GSM-R (Safety) Broadcasts to pass safety critical information
to Drivers with the Driver confirming receipt and acknowledging understanding by using the ‘acknowledgement’ button.
The trial involves Greater Anglia, MTR, c2c and freight services only and will be for CRT Sites and Underline Bridge
Strikes.
The trial will be limited to the following areas only:
Upminster IECC – London Fenchurch St to Shoeburyness inclusive (Thameside)
Liverpool St IECC – London Liverpool St to Shenfield inclusive (Mains and Electric Lines)
Methodology
    1.   Signaller advised/identifies the requirement to caution
    2.   Signaller decides whether cautioning using GSM-R is possible and the signals where the berth broadcast is to be
         triggered (these may be predefined for some trial scenarios covering static locations e.g. Bridges)
    3.   Signaller records the caution message to a set script and stores it on the system (unless pre-recorded message
         exists)
    4.   The message content shall contain full words and no abbreviations.
    5.   The message shall be recorded to the set scripts using the ‘Safety’ identifier.
    6.   The message shall make it clear that the message is complete.
    7.   The berth triggered broadcast will be active for a period of four hours and will need to be reset or a new message
         recorded to supersede it.
    8.   Only one berth broadcast can be recorded per signaller, but the message can be triggered at separate signal
         berths on several lines.
