MD101 – EUSTON TO ARMITAGE JUNCTION (EXCLUSIVE)
LICHFIELD TRENT VALLEY

Stafford and Lichfield Trent Valley – LS1301 and LS1303 duplicate signal numbers. Following the re-signalling of
the Stafford area, there are two pairs of signals with the same identities, one pair at Lichfield Trent Valley, controlled from
Trent Valley Workstation in Rugby SCC, and the other pair at Stafford station, controlled from Stafford Workstation in
Rugby ROC.

To reduce the risk of miscommunication, all persons calling from any of these signals (whether using the signal post
telephone or any other means) or referring to these locations, must state either “Stafford” or “Trent Valley”, as appropriate,
before stating the signal prefix and number when referring to signal LS1301 or LS1303. These instructions also apply to
written records and forms.

The signals will be plated as follows:
•       Stafford LS1301
•       Trent Valley LS1301
•       Stafford LS1303
•       Trent Valley LS1303

                                                                                                             Dated: 01/09/15
