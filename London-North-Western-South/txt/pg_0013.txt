Section 13, Clause 13.2.3 Line blockages with a train in section
TERMINAL AND DEAD END PLATFORM LINES
It is not permitted to grant a line blockage over any of the lines in the LNW Sectional Appendix with a train in
the signalling section. Signallers must wait for the train to clear the signalling section before granting
permission to go on the track. However, this does not apply on the Up & Down ST. Albans Line, MD130 as
long as the signaller gets an assurance from the driver that the train will not be moved until authorised.
