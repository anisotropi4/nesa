MD120 - CAMDEN JUNCTION TO WATFORD JUNCTION (DC LINES)
Camden Jn To SOUTH HAMPSTEAD

BETWEEN CAMDEN JUNCTION AND SOUTH HAMPSTEAD
South Hampstead tunnels. In the event of a failure of the radio equipment rendering the Driver of a (D.O.O.) DC
passenger train unable to communicate with Wembley Mainline SCC, the following conditions will apply. The train must
not be allowed to proceed through either of the single bores of South Hampstead Tunnel until arrangements have been
made either for the passengers to be detrained or for the train to be accompanied by a competent person. The
Competent Person must travel with the train between Euston and South Hampstead to assist the Driver and work to his
instructions in the event of an emergency arising. Clauses 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 on page 5 of the Driver Only Operation
(Passenger) General Instructions are modified accordingly.
During an emergency when a train or trains may be detained between stations for an excessive amount of time, authority
may be given to move such trains to the stations in advance or in rear where the platform may already be occupied. In
such circumstances, communication between the Signaller and Drivers must be by the Signal Post Telephone in the case
of London Underground Limited trains or by GSM-R or Signal Post Telephone in the case of London Overground train
services.

When it is required to move a detained passenger train into an already occupied platform, the Signaller will contact
the Driver of the train occupying the platform and advise him of the circumstances and from which direction the detained
train will approach. The Signaller will request the Driver of the train occupying the platform for assurances that:-
        All passengers have been detrained.
        There is sufficient room in the platform to accommodate at least one vehicle of the detained train plus a 2 metre
         gap between the two trains.
If there is not sufficient room, the Signaller will instruct the Driver to draw forward, in accordance with Rule Book, Module
S5 Part A, Section 1.1, if appropriate, or set back until sufficient room is available. The Driver must advise the Signaller
when the movement is complete and give further assurances that:-
        One or more tail lights are illuminated in the direction in which the detained train will approach.
        That the Driver will make no further movement until instructed to do so by the Signaller regardless of any signal
         aspect displayed.
The Signaller will then contact the Driver of the detained train and advise him/her of the circumstances and instruct
him/her to draw forward in accordance with Rule Book, Module S5 Part A, Section 1.1, or set back as appropriate.
When instructed to proceed, the Driver of the detained train must:-
        Drive from the leading cab in the direction of travel.
        Proceed at caution prepared to stop short of any obstruction.
        Bring the train to a stand immediately before entering the platform.
        Proceed with extreme caution into the platform bringing the train to a stand not less than 2 metres (2 yards) clear
         of the train already in the platform.
        Release the doors only of those vehicles which are completely accommodated in the platform.
        Advise the Signaller that the movement is complete and give an assurance that he/she will make no further
         movement until instructed by the Signaller regardless of any signal aspect displayed.
When it is possible to resume normal working, Drivers will be authorised individually by the Signaller and the provisions of
Rule Book, Module S5 Part A, Section 1.1, will be applied where appropriate.
                                                                                                               Dated: 28/06/14
