       Section 14 - Instructions for examining the OLE
       On receiving a report from a Driver of an ADD activation the requirements of this instruction should be complied with
       provided all the following conditions apply:
         • The train involved is a Virgin class 390 (Pendolino).
         • No loss of OHL supply has occurred (no tripping).
         • The pantograph in use at the time of the ADD activation has been lowered and the second pantograph
           has been raised, no loss of OHL supply occurred (no tripping).
       The next train through the section on the affected line must be cautioned to examine the line at a speed not exceeding
       20mph from point of ADD to the location where the previous train came to a stand. In this circumstance there is no
       requirement to examine from an adjacent line.
       Where primary means of supporting the OLE is by a headspan wire then the 20mph speed restriction must be applied on
       all lines until the above examination procedure is carried out successfully on each line or is proved clear by alternative
       means.
       Provided the examination(s) report no issues and there is no further ADD activation or tripping occurrences, normal
       working may resume.
       The infrastructure maintenance OHL teams must be called to inspect/patrol as normal by the ECO.

       Section 5 - Communications procedure
       LNW SOUTH ALL LINES
       Using GSM-R berth triggered messages and non-verbal acknowledgement to caution Drivers
       Signallers can set up automated messages to caution train drivers for:
         •  Poor railhead conditions.
         •  Animals on the line (but not inside tunnels).
         •  Defective Emergency indicators.
         •  Unusual events (Not Track or Signalling).
       All trains fitted with GSM-R will receive the broadcast message. Drivers of services NOT fitted with version 3.5 software do
       not have an ST button so must disregard the GSM-R berth triggered safety broadcast and bring their train to a stand at the
       protecting signal and contact the Signaller.
