MD101 - EUSTON TO ARMITAGE JUNCTION (EXCLUSIVE)
NUNEATON

The Signaller at Rugby S.C.C. will, when possible, route a diverted Virgin Trains West Coast Up service, hauled by a
diesel locomotive from the Birmingham direction, into platform 5. In these circumstances the Driver must bring the train to
a stand at signal RN.5436 at the south end of the platform, where the diesel locomotive will be detached. This movement
is to ensure that the whole train is platformed.
The Signaller at Rugby S.C.C. will, when possible, route a diverted Arriva Cross Country Up direction service from the
Tamworth direction, for a reversal movement at Nuneaton for the Birmingham direction, formed of either 2 x Class 220 or
2 x Class 221 units, conveying 8/9 or 10 vehicles into platform 5.
If the Signaller at Rugby S.C.C. is in a position to clear the position light signal associated with signal RN.5436 at the
south end of platform 5, he will do so. The train doors may then be released for station duties.
If the Signaller at Rugby S.C.C. is unable to clear the position light signal associated with signal RN.5436 at the south end
of platform 5, then the Driver must bring the train to a stand at signal RN.5436. The Signaller at Rugby S.C.C. must then
be advised when station duties have been completed. Upon clearance of the position light signal associated with signal
RN.5436 the Driver may draw the train forward and bring the train to a stand at the far (south) end of platform 5 for a
reversal movement. These movements are to ensure that the rear of such a train is standing inside clear of signal
NL.9547 at the north end of platform 5.
