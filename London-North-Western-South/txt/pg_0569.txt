MD320 - PROOF HOUSE JN TO BUSHBURY JN (VIA BESCOT)
Curzon Street Jn

An additional A.W.S. magnet is located immediately in advance of Signal PA.141. It will normally be supressed when
the signal is cleared. If a Driver is authorised to pass the signal at Danger, the A.W.S. horn (warning indicator) will sound
when the train passes the signal.
If the A.W.S. horn (warning indicator) sounds on any other occasion as a train passes the signal, the train must be
stopped immediately and the Driver must contact the Signaller.
