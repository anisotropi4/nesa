An additional A.W.S. magnet is located immediately in advance of Signal WM.194. It will normally be suppressed when
the signal is cleared. If a Driver is authorised to pass the signal at Danger, the A.W.S. horn (warning indicator) will sound
when the train passes the signal. If the A.W.S. horn (warning indicator) sounds on any other occasion as a train passes
the signal, the train must be stopped immediately and the Driver must contact the Signaller.

Drivers working trains from these sidings, must, after completion of the required cab preparation duties, contact the
Signaller at West Midlands S.C. â€“ Snow Hill workstation and advise that their train is ready to leave the sidings.
