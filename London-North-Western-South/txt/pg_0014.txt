TERMINAL AND DEAD-END PLATFORM LINES
At terminal and dead-end platform lines, the Signaller is permitted to grant possession to the PICOP (and the PICOP is
permitted to give up the possession to the Signaller) when a platform line where the train detection is by means of track
circuits and not by axle counters is occupied by an empty coaching stock (ECS) train.

authorised by the Operations Manager.
Stabling of trains at terminal and dead-end platform lines when work must be carried out between the buffer stops and the
