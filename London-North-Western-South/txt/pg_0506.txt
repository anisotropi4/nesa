       When there is a requirement to attach and detach a bank engine to assist a freight train in rear between Stourbridge
       Junction and Langley Green in accordance with Section 1 Table J, ‘Locomotives assisting in rear of trains’, then the
       following instructions will apply:
       The bank engine will be positioned at Stourbridge Junction and when it arrives, its Driver must contact West Midlands SC
       Stourbridge Workstation to provide his contact details. When the freight train that requires assistance in rear has arrived
       on the Down Siding at Stourbridge Junction the bank engine will be attached to the rear of the freight train.
       The Driver of the freight train that requires assistance in rear must obtain the permission of West Midlands SC Stourbridge
       Workstation to pass the ‘Stop’ board on the Down Siding to draw the train forward towards signal SJ641 which will be
       cleared, if necessary, to enable the freight train that requires to be assisted in rear to draw forward towards the Up
       Stourbridge line to allow the bank engine to be attached.
       In the event that communication is not available between the Driver of the freight train being assisted in rear and the Driver
       of the bank engine, then the Driver of the freight train being assisted in rear must communicate with West Midlands SC
       Stourbridge Workstation. The Driver of the bank engine must contact West Midlands SC Stourbridge Workstation who will
       then communicate with the Driver of the freight train to be assisted in rear and give an assurance that the bank engine has
       been coupled to the rear of the train; after completion of a brake continuity test the train will be ready to depart.
       In the event that it is not possible to draw the freight train that requires assistance forward onto the Up Stourbridge line to
       attach the bank engine to the rear, then the Driver of the freight train must obtain the permission of West Midlands SC
       Stourbridge Workstation to pass the ‘Stop’ board on the Down Siding to draw the train forward towards signal SJ641 and
       upon clearance of this signal, the train will proceed onto the Neck for the bank engine to be attached to the rear. When
       coupling of the bank engine has been completed the Driver of the freight train will inform West Midlands SC Stourbridge
       Workstation who will then clear signal SJ642 and authorise the Driver of the assisted freight train to draw back to stand
       inside clear of signal SJ641.
       The Driver of the bank engine must not apply power until the assisted freight train has cleared Stourbridge North Junction.
       On arrival at either signal SJ26 on the Up Stourbridge line or signal SJ24 on the Up Rood End Goods Loop at Langley
       Green, the Driver of the bank engine will uncouple the assisting engine and contact West Midlands SC Stourbridge
       Workstation to advise them that the bank engine has been uncoupled and the train previously assisted in rear is ready to
       depart. The Signaller will then clear signal SJ24 or SJ26 for the freight train to depart.
       If the bank engine is to return to Stourbridge Junction, West Midlands SC Stourbridge Workstation will clear signals SJ619
       or SJ617 for the bank engine to proceed. If the bank engine is to continue on the Up Stourbridge, the Driver will contact
       West Midlands SC Stourbridge Workstation for authority to proceed towards either signal SJ24 or SJ26
                                                           Dated: 28/08/12
