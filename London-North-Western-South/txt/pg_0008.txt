Rule Book Module SP - Speeds : Emergency speed
restriction
Section 4 – Emergency Speed restrictions (ESR) - How emergency speed restrictions
are set up
If an emergency speed restriction (ESR) is imposed and before the speed restriction equipment has been set up, the
signaller will tell the driver of a train to pass over the ESR the actual speed limit that has been imposed by the engineer.
It will no longer be necessary for the drivers of all trains to proceed at no more than 20 mph prior to the erection of the
speed restriction equipment but drivers must travel over the restriction at no more than the speed given by the signaller.
This also means that only trains which would normally be running at a speed higher than the ESR to be imposed will need
to be cautioned by the signaller. For example, if an ESR of 60 mph is imposed, it will not be necessary to stop and advise
the drivers of trains classes 6, 7 or 8.
                                                                                           National GI - Dated: 07/06/14
