       Wheel Impact Load Detector (Wheelchex). This equipment analyses the dynamic wheel loads produced by each
       passing train. The data obtained may result in an alarm being received in Network Rail, Route Control. A Wheelchex
       system is installed on the Down Gloucester and Up Gloucester lines at 75m 46ch. If an alarm is received from the
       detector, the train will be stopped by signals and the Driver may be instructed by the Signaller to proceed at a reduced
       speed to a location where the train can be taken out of service.
