Wolverton Works Siding

Working of movements to/from Wolverton Centre Sidings and Wolverton Works Sidings
Before a movement enters the Centre Sidings the Signaller will contact the Railcare Person in Charge to obtain
permission. Separate releases are provided for both the north and south connections to the sidings. The person
operating the release may do so provided that the hand points are set for the move and the destination siding has
sufficient space to accommodate the train. The person operating the release should be aware that the release is only
maintained for 10 seconds and should not be given until the movement is ready to proceed.

Before a movement proceeds from the Centre Sidings to the Main line the person responsible for the movement will
contact the Signaller and advise the reporting number, speed and destination of the train.

Movements to/from Wolverton Works Sidings and the Centre Sidings are under the responsibility of the Railcare
Person in Charge who must ensure the line is clear throughout before authorising a movement. The person responsible
for the movement should contact the Signaller to obtain clearance of signal KR.1496 for movements to the Incline Siding
and signal KR.1497 for movements from the Incline Siding. When the movement is complete, the person responsible for
the movement must inform the Signaller.

During times of disruption or other special circumstances a Network Rail nominee may be appointed as the Person in
Charge.
