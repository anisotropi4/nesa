       power at the coasting board and allow the train to coast before bringing the train to a normal stop at the platform.

       Dynamic Risk Assessment
       This notice is to advise that Dynamic Risk Assessment process is authorised for use under trial conditions.
       The purpose of DRA is to provide a continuous assessment of risk in the rapidly changing circumstances of an operational
       incident, in order to implement control measures necessary to make certain of an acceptable level of safety.
       Its application should be applied by operational management staff seeking to assess operational system risk, and identify
       control measures that deliver a safety benefit in rapidly changing operational incidents affecting the normal operation of the
       railway.
       The Scope of DRA is currently restricted for trial purposes to London South Eastern route (Anglia, Kent Sussex), LNW
       route, Scotland route and Western Route.
       DRA can only be facilitated and implemented by those trained to do so.
