A Competent Person must be in attendance at Fosseway A.H.B. level crossing to authorise a movement to proceed
over the level crossing before the movement is authorised to proceed to and return from the Anglesea Sidings Branch.
Before the Signaller at Aston box clears signal AN.160 on the Up Main line or signal AN.162 on the Down Main line at
Lichfield Trent Valley for a movement to proceed towards signal AN.154 at Lichfield City, he must receive an assurance
from the Competent Person that he is in attendance at Fosseway A.H.B. level crossing. Upon receiving such assurance
the Signaller at Aston box will clear signal AN.160 or signal AN.162 for the movement to proceed towards signal AN.154 at
Lichfield City. Upon clearance of signal AN.154 at Lichfield City the Driver must proceed cautiously towards Fosseway
A.H.B. level crossing and be prepared to stop short of Fosseway A.H.B. level crossing adjacent to the Competent Person
exhibiting a Red Handsignal. The Competent Person will authorise the Driver to proceed over the level crossing.
Before returning from Anglesea Sidings to Lichfield City the Driver of a movement must contact the Signaller at Aston box
and obtain permission to proceed. The Driver must then proceed cautiously towards Fosseway A.H.B. level crossing and
bring the train to a stand adjacent to the Competent Person exhibiting a Red Handsignal. The Competent Person will
authorise the Driver to proceed over the level crossing. If the telephone at Anglesea Sidings should fail, then the Driver
may leave Anglesea Sidings without the permission of the Signaller at Aston box and work to the same instructions
published in this paragraph.
Before the Signaller at Aston box clears signal AN.157 for the movement to proceed to the Down Main line, he will obtain
an assurance from the Driver that the movement is complete with tail lamp.
