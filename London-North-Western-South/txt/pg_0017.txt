ANIMALS ON THE LINE
NOTICE TO TRAINCREW, SIGNALLERS AND CONTROLLERS

Where the rules and regulations (Rule Book Module TS1, Section 18.2 and Rule Book Module TW1 section 25) require
that trains be cautioned because of animals on the line, this procedure need not be applied providing that the animals are:

         domestic, for example, dogs
         deer
         not more than six sheep

However, drivers are still required to make an initial report of the animals being ‘on the line’ and maintenance response
teams are mobilised to establish where the animals gained access to the line and where necessary effect repairs.

Once a report is received from a driver, then a general call will be put out via GSM-R to all trains in the area, advising
them of the approximate vicinity of the incursion and that they are not required to stop to report the incident.

Drivers are advised that if they believe the safety of trains is at risk then they are instructed to carry out the relevant
provisions of the Rule Book.

SWANS ON THE LINE

A train need only be cautioned for a swan on the line if the swan is reported to be within the “four foot” of the line
concerned


                                                                                 LNW South Route GI - Dated: 03/12/16


ASSISTING TRAINS ON STEEP GRADIENTS - LOW RAIL
ADHESION
During times of low rail adhesion, trains which have stopped on rising gradients steeper than 1 in 60 due to failure
between the following points should normally be assisted in the rear:
          Bromsgrove to Blackwell
If this is not practicable, however, the failure can be assisted from the front provided that the assisting loco/ unit:
         is fitted with sanding equipment which is working, and
         does not exceed 4 mph on the steep falling gradient approaching the disabled train’
                                                                                 LNW South Route GI - Dated: 21/10/17
