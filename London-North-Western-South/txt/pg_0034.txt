Giving Up a T3 Around a Train Rule Book T3 Section 7
and Handbook 11 Section 12.2
It is not permitted to give up a T3 possession around an engineering train(s) or OTM(s) that does not reliably
work track circuits. If a technical problem means it will no longer operate track circuits reliably, the PICOP
must contact the controlling signalbox or workstation. The PICOP must arrange for the train(s) or OTM(s) to
exit the possession site at caution before giving up the T3 possession, and ensure the signaller is made aware
that the train(s) or OTM(s) will no longer reliably work track circuits.

                                                                            LNW South Route GI - Dated: 02/12/17



High Output Ballast Cleaner (HOBC) and Track Relaying
Systems (TRS) Trains
These trains are authorised to transit between their operating bases and engineering possessions in excess of the normal
route length limits provided that a suitable train path has been identified.
The train identification used and maximum lengths (including locomotives) are as follows:
HOBC 6Y07 or 6Y15          127 SLUs / 811 metres / 887 yards / 2659 feet
MOBC 6Y19                  105 SLUs / 670 metres / 733 yards / 2198 feet
TRS 6X01 or 6X04           117 SLUs / 744 metres / 813 yards / 2439 feet
The HOBC and TRS may also exceed the maximum permitted single engine load between the locations listed below. In
these circumstances the train concerned must operate with a locomotive at each end. The rear loco is authorised to apply
power as directed by the lead driver to assist as required in the negotiation of inclines between the mileages shown. In
these cases both locomotives must be manned as per Train Company manning agreements and equipped with back to
back radios.
Rule Book, Module TW1, Section 15.1 is modified accordingly.
