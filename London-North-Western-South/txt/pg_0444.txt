MD101 - EUSTON TO ARMITAGE JUNCTION (EXCLUSIVE)
EUSTON

Starting of trains. Rule Book, Module SS1, Section 3.5
The Ready to Start signal must not be given by means of the bell/buzzer communication, it must be given for all trains by
means of the Right Away indicator.
Working into and out of the Passenger Platform Lines. The Responsible Person must make arrangements for any
locomotive attached to the train to supply Electric Train Heating to be uncoupled before another locomotive is coupled to
the train. If the locomotive of an incoming train is not required to propel the coaches from the platform, it must (after being
detached from the train) remain stationary at the buffer stops until the departing train has drawn clear of the platform
starting signal. Any subsequent movement of the locomotive must only be made after the permission of the Signaller has
been obtained. The Driver of the locomotive will be responsible for advising the Signaller when ready to move.
Uncoupling of train locomotives. Drivers of incoming trains, if programmed to leave locomotives coupled and
unmanned, must always leave the locomotive sufficiently eased up to slacken the coupling between the locomotive and
train when the type of locomotive allows this to be done without further movement to the train whilst passengers are
alighting.
Propelling movements. A member of the Euston shunting staff must be in charge of every propelling movement. Trains
propelled to the Up Carriage Sidings must have the continuous brake connected and be controlled by a Shunter riding in
the leading vehicle. The Shunter in Charge of a propelling movement which has to be maintained at a stand must secure
the emergency brake handle in the ON position and make use of the tool specially provided for this purpose when the
stock is equipped with the vacuum brake.
Platforms to the Up Carriage Sidings. When a train is propelled from the station to the Up Carriage Sidings, the
locomotive must remain attached until the Shunter gives the Driver permission for it to be detached. Before the Shunter
does so he must put on and chain the hand brakes in at least two brakevans and place at least four scotches under the
wheels of the two vehicles nearest the station. The continuous brake must be destroyed, and in the case of a vacuum
braked train, the vacuum hosepipe at the station end of the train must not be replaced on the dummy coupling when the
locomotive is detached. He must also see that a red light is placed on the vehicles at both ends of the train after sunset
and during fog or falling snow.
After the train has been secured, it must not be moved again until the Shunter in Charge of the operation is satisfied that
the scotches have been taken from under the wheels and the hand brakes released.
After sunset and during fog or failing snow, a red light must be exhibited on the locomotive at the station end. A red light
must be exhibited on the leading vehicle of all trains backing out of platforms after sunset and during fog or failing snow.
Working into and out of the Up Carriage Sidings at Euston. All electric multiple unit trains must be driven into the
sidings from the leading end.
Ordinary Coaching stock may be either propelled or hauled into these sidings as required. When a locomotive has been
put into the sidings to bring a train out, it must be at once coupled. Locomotive hauled trains and E.M.U.’s must not move
towards the exit signal until the Shunter has advised the Signaller at Wembley Mainline SCC that the train is ready, where
the coaches are for, and has obtained the necessary permission. Trains being propelled from the sidings by a locomotive
must have a shunter in the leading vehicle fitted with a brake valve and a route must be set up into the station before any
movement is made.
Working in the Middle Sidings. After working trains into the Middle Siding or Middle Sidings 1 and 2. Drivers of departing
locomotives must await instructions from the Signaller at Wembley Mainline SCC before moving towards the exit signal.
Drivers taking over locomotives or trains in the Middle Sidings must obtain permission to move, by telephone, from the
Signaller at Wembley Mainline SCC.
Working of Class 253/254 trains. Class 253/254 trains are prohibited from using platforms 1 to 3, 8 to 11 and 16 & 17.
The Driver of a Class 253/254 train entering platforms 4 to 7 or 12 to 15 must not proceed beyond the ‘HST Stop’ Board at
the South end of the platform. Immediately upon arrival in the platform, the leading power car must be shut down and not
restarted until 10 minutes before expected departure time.

                                                                                                          Dated: 05/06/2021
