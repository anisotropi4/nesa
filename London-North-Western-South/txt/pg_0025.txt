       The following arrangements apply for the passage of trains over broken rails in the Western Route tunnels listed in the
       table below.
       A yellow handlamp will usually be placed in the four-foot at a distance of 5 metres (or 5 yards) on the approach side of the
       rail defect to help the Driver locate the defect’s position.
       Unless it can be established for certain that a yellow lamp has been provided, the Driver will be instructed not to
       exceed 5 mph throughout the length of the tunnel.
       Trains on the adjacent lines will be stopped whenever a movement is authorised on the affected line and on other
       occasions when the person inspecting the defect requests it.
