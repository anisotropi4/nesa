       Rule Book Module TS1 - General signalling regulations
       Section 13, Clause 13.2.3 Line blockages with a train in section
       TERMINAL AND DEAD END PLATFORM LINES
       It is not permitted to grant a line blockage over any of the lines in the LNW Sectional Appendix with a train in
       the signalling section. Signallers must wait for the train to clear the signalling section before granting
       permission to go on the track. However, this does not apply on the Up & Down ST. Albans Line, MD130 as
       long as the signaller gets an assurance from the driver that the train will not be moved until authorised.

       The following arrangements apply for the passage of trains over broken rails in the Western Route tunnels listed in the
       table below.
       A yellow handlamp will usually be placed in the four-foot at a distance of 5 metres (or 5 yards) on the approach side of the
       rail defect to help the Driver locate the defect’s position.
       Unless it can be established for certain that a yellow lamp has been provided, the Driver will be instructed not to
       exceed 5 mph throughout the length of the tunnel.
       Trains on the adjacent lines will be stopped whenever a movement is authorised on the affected line and on other
       occasions when the person inspecting the defect requests it.
