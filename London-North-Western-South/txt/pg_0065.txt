       Obstacle Detection (OD) Level Crossings on LNW Route
       OD level crossings work automatically and are similar to CCTV crossings in that they have full barriers, road traffic signals
       and have protecting signals with telephones linked to the signalbox. Instead of a CCTV camera they use a combination of
       Radar and Lidar (laser radar) to check that there are no objects or persons within the level crossing before a train
       approaches. The normal position of the barriers is raised.
       The following modules contained within GE/RT8000 are amended when working with OD level crossings:
       Duties of a level crossing attendant Handbook 18
       Qualified attendants are not permitted to operate an OD crossing until they have been instructed on its use. A copy of the
       attendantâ€™s instructions showing the method of working can be found in the REB at the crossing.
