Passenger trains - emergency sanding equipment
Certain passenger trains other than locomotive hauled trains and Class 165/166 Diesel Multiple Units are fitted with
sanding equipment, which the Driver will operate when it is necessary to stop the train in conditions of very low adhesion.
Where each driving cab carries one application of sand, once the equipment has been operated from that cab, the facility
will not be available again until the containers have been replaced.
Drivers’ Actions. When the emergency sanding equipment has been used the train must be brought to a stand and the
Driver must inform the Signaller immediately and report the following:
a)   that the emergency sanding equipment has been operated,
b)   the location where the emergency sanding equipment was discharged and the current location of the train.
If the Signaller cannot be contacted immediately via the GSM-R or a signal post telephone, the Driver must place a track
circuit operating clip on the line immediately in front of the train. To avoid delay, if the Driver alights to use a signal post
telephone, a track circuit operating clip should be taken as well. The Signaller may instruct the Driver to place a track
circuit operating clip on the line immediately in front of the train.
