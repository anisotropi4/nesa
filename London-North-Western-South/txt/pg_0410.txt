Down Goods Loop or the Up & Down Slow line.

controlling set back movements from the 'Up & Down' Slow line, will be the Driver's authority to commence the setting
back movement. The setting back movement must be made at walking pace and the Driver must be prepared to act on a
handsignal from the Guard or Shunter when he comes into view.
