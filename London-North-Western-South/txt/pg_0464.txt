movements are made in one direction only or on an unaffected route. The Signaller at Marston Vale SCC will advise the
Driver of the circumstances and will be authorised to pass the signal controlling the entrance to the affected portion of line

each train.

ensure that the following actions are carried out.
The Signaller will maintain signal MV.18 (signal in rear of MV.105 signal) on the Up Main line at Danger and when the
Driver makes contacts from the signal post telephone, the Signaller will inform him/her that signal MV.105 is ground
mounted and positioned in the six foot.
