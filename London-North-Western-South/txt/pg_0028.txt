Positive testing of the tripcock must be undertaken utilising the following method:
   The Signaller at Wembley Mainline SCC will bring trains to a stand, using the normal signalling sequence, to the next
    signal that can be placed to Danger.
   The Signaller at Wembley Mainline SCC will advise Drivers of the circumstances and authorise them to pass the
    signal maintained at Danger and to proceed at a speed no more than 5 mph to ensure that no violent braking takes
    place.
   The Driver must advise the Signaller at Wembley Mainline SCC of the outcome of the test by means of the GSM-R
    equipment where provided.

The following action must be taken whenever a train passes a tripcock tester:
           Indication                                                        Action
Light is extinguished.               Test satisfactory, no action required by the Driver.
Light is extinguished but train is   Driver must advise the Signaller at Wembley Mainline SCC, re-set the Tripcock and
tripped.                             continue on his journey.
Light is not extinguished and        Driver must immediately advise the Signaller at Wembley Mainline SCC then
train is/is not tripped.             continue his journey, but proceed at a speed no more that 25 mph between Kilburn
                                     High Road and Harrow & Wealdstone and vice versa. The Signaller at Wembley
                                     Mainline SCC will arrange for the Signal Technician to examine the test apparatus
                                     and for the tripcock to be examined at the train's destination. The train must not be
                                     returned to service until the tripcock is working correctly. In such cases passengers
                                     must be immediately detrained and the train taken out of service.


If a tripcock becomes defective or cannot be re-set, it must be isolated. The Driver must immediately advise the Signaller
at Wembley Mainline SCC and continue his journey, but to travel at a speed not exceeding 25 mph between Kilburn High
Road and Harrow & Wealdstone and vice versa. An entry must be made in the unit defect book and the train must be
taken out of service at the first suitable location, without causing unnecessary delay or cancellation and not to re-enter
service until the defect is remedied. If a Driver becomes aware that a tripcock is isolated whilst in service, he must first
inform the Signaller at Wembley Mainline SCC, then check the unit defect book. If there is no entry in the repair book
regarding the tripcock, he must de-isolate it and attempt to re-set it. If the tripcock re-sets, the Driver may proceed as
normal but must enter the circumstances in the unit defect book. If the tripcock will not re-set, the Driver must proceed as
described in the previous paragraph.
LONDON UNDERGROUND LIMITED (LUL) ONE PERSON OPERATED TRAINS
An emergency door cock is provided on the outside of each coach, located towards the centre of the coach, to enable one
pair of doors on that side of the coach to be opened in an emergency. Staff must not operate these cocks until they have
informed the Train Operator of the circumstances.
When it is necessary for a train which has been taken out of service, owing to a defective deadman’s valve or tripcock, to
proceed to the nearest suitable depot or siding, a member of staff specially authorised by the Network Rail Co-ordinator to
assist the Train Operator in the observance of signals must be provided. If this is not possible, the LUL Line Controller
must be requested to provide an authorised member of LUL staff. If the defect occurs on the last train of the day to a
destination, the train may remain in service, but it must be driven at a speed at which it can be stopped short of any
obstruction, and an authorised member of staff, as defined above, must accompany the Train Operator.
                                                                                LNW South Route GI - Dated: 07/05/16
