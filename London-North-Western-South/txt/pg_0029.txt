CLASS 253/254 (HST) - ISSUE OF REDUCED SPEED
CERTIFICATES
When agreed between Operations Control, TOC Control and others concerned that an HST (loaded or empty) is to
continue in service with specified on-train equipment defects, the following procedure must apply:
Fleet Maintenance personnel (or anyone else) becoming aware of any defect requiring an HST train to run at reduced
    speed must immediately report the details to TOC Control. If the train has to be stopped out of course in order to
    do this, the Driver must tell the Signaller immediately as for any other incident.
TOC Control must tell Operations Control and must arrange entry of the necessary details into the POIS defect system.
Having reached a clear understanding on the details and the restriction that must apply, TOC Control must instruct the
    Person in Charge at the starting point of the trainâ€™s next journey to fill in a Reduced Speed Certificate (see example on
    next page) and hand it to the Driver. The certificate must indicate which vehicle(s) are defective, the relevant code
    letter and the nature of the restriction.
If the starting point of the next journey is unstaffed or it has not been possible to contact any staff on duty there, TOC
      Control must arrange to tell the Driver about the restriction by the quickest possible means (including cab fixed radio if
      necessary). This need NOT apply when TOC Control is sure that the next journey is to be worked by the same Driver
      and he is already aware. Whichever is the case, TOC Control must arrange for the certificate to be issued at the next
      suitable stopping point of that train.
