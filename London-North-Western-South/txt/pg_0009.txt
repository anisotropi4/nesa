Worcester Shrub Hill – semaphore signals
Two disc shaped signals, one above the other, are provided under the station canopy approximately midway along the
Down Platform line. The larger (upper) signal is the Down Main starting signal and must be treated as a semaphore main
stop arm as described in section 3.2 of the Handbook.
The smaller (lower) signal is the Down Main calling-on signal and must be regarded as a semaphore subsidiary calling-on
arm as described in section 3.4 of the Handbook.
