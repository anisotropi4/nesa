Section 8 - Incidents involving exterior doors
The rule must apply also to HST Power Car sliding doors. The TOC concerned must tell Operations Control about any
services on which Power Car sliding doors are secured out of use. Should it be necessary to secure any Power Car sliding
door out of use, the sliding door on the opposite side of the train must also be secured out of use.
Only one Power Car on which the sliding doors are secured out of use may be formed in a set except when specially
authorised by Operations Control. Should the Power Car sliding window also be defective, the set must not be allowed in
service.
Access must be maintained from the adjacent trailer vehicle to the Power Car.
HSTs on which any Power Car sliding doors are secured out of use must NOT convey passengers through Ledbury
Tunnel.

Rule Book Module TW3 - Preparation and movement of
locomotive-hauled trains
Section 12, Clause 12.1 - Before the movement begins
Operating instructions in connection with the operation of the high output system for trains over the
LNW Route.
Powering the rear locomotive.
This instruction applies to:
         a) High Output Ballast Cleaner (HOBC)
         b) High Output Track Relayer (HOTR)
Due to the length of these trains and that they may be overweight under normal traction arrangements the following trains
are authorised to operate with a locomotive provided at each end of the train
6H90 – Operated by DB Schenker
6Y60 – Operated by Freightliner
The instruction will apply regardless of whether the train is travelling to or from a possession, or when transiting between
High Output Operating Bases (HOOB’s)
A driver will be provided in each locomotive and communication equipment will be provided for use by each driver to
communicate with each other as required.
The rear loco is authorised to apply traction power to assist when necessary in negotiation of the route.
Each freight operating company for these trains must, under these conditions, provide a detailed method of operation to
the drivers operating the HOBC train. That detail must include:
    •    What the method of communication will be between the drivers.
    •    The agreed structure of communication between the lead driver and rear driver when it becomes necessary for
         the rear locomotive to apply traction power and when traction power from the rear is no longer required.
Should communication be lost between the leading and rear locomotive drivers whilst in transit the train must be bought to
a stand immediately and the signaller advised. No further movement must be made until communications are again
established between the leading and rear locomotive drivers OR the train is declared a failure in accordance with Rule
Book Module M2 and assistance provided.
