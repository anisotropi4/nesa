Former Saltley Depot (Saltley L.I.P) and European Metals Recycling (EMR) Sidings

General: Former Saltley Depot (also known as the Saltley L.I.P), and European Metals Recycling (EMR) Sidings are
located off the Down Saltley Goods Loop adjacent to Landor St Junction. The length of EMR No.1 & No.2 Siding is 235m /
770ft
Person in Charge (PIC): When taking up duty for EMR services the PIC must provide their name and mobile telephone
number to the Washwood Heath Workstation Signaller at WMSC on Telephone 0121 576 2011 and report to the Signaller
when their turn of duty is completed. The PIC may contact the Signaller for signalled shunt moves.
All points within both the Former Saltley Depot and EMR Sidings complex are hand operated. The PIC of any movement
within the Sidings must ensure hand points are set in the correct position for the movement.
Arrivals:
Former Saltley Depot :
If there is no PIC on duty, the Signaller may authorise a light engine movement only.
The Driver of an arriving locomotive must bring the movement to a stand at the ‘Stop and Check Points’ board. The Driver
must check that the hand points are in the correct position before proceeding onto the single siding.
European Metals Recycling Sidings:
Trains destined for EMR Sidings will arrive on the Down Saltley Goods Loop. Trains that arrive from the Water Orton
direction are required to conduct a locomotive run round on the Tyseley Through Sidings. The train will arrive on the Down
Saltley Goods Loop via Landor St Junction. All arriving trains are propelled into the site from the Down Saltley Goods
Loop.
Upon arrival on the Down Saltley Goods Loop the PIC will hand a Radio to the train driver and must reach a clear
understanding with the Driver and the Washwood Heath Workstation Signaller concerning the movements to access the
EMR Sidings. The PIC will check all hand points are set correctly, advise the Signaller that the train is ready to propel into
EMR sidings and ensure that the Position Light on Signal WP8911 is cleared. The PIC shall split the train into portions
within the EMR Siding and ensure the train is secure. The PIC may request Signal WP1898 is cleared for shunting
movements if necessary.
During a wagon set turn over shunt, the PIC may request Signal WP1898 is cleared for shunting movements if necessary.
Departures:
Former Saltley Depot:
Before departure, the Driver of a departing locomotive must obtain permission to proceed towards Signal WP1898 from
the Washwood Heath Workstation Signaller. When permission has been obtained the Driver must ensure that no other
movements are taking place before proceeding towards Signal WP1898. If the Signaller is unable to give permission for
the movement, they will instruct the Driver to request permission again after a given period.
European Metals Recycling Sidings:
The PIC shall marshal the train within the EMR Sidings and complete a brake test. The PIC may request Signal WP1898
is cleared for shunting movements if necessary. The PIC will contact the Washwood Heath Workstation Signaller to obtain
permission for the train to depart Signal WP1898 onto the Down Saltley Goods Loop.
Shunting Movements:
When shunt movements are required the PIC must advise the Washwood Heath Workstation Signaller that a movement is
about to commence. The Signaller will give permission providing no other movement has been authorised. Once all
shunting movements have been completed the PIC must advise the Washwood Heath Workstation Signaller.
Signal WP1898 is set to return to danger after each movement. It is imperative that all Drivers are aware of this when
making repeat shunting movements in proximity of this Signal and that they ensure the Signal is cleared prior to making
any movements beyond it.
