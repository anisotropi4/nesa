most lines within all Network Rail routes, these vehicles are painted yellow and carry Network Rail logos.
Trains with these vehicles in them generally operate with a ‘Q’ headcode so as to denote that they are line
specific.

identified as a binding brake or sparks being emitted from the bogies, and as such, does not require to be
reported to the controlling Signaller. However, if in any doubt, then normal operating procedures should be
applied.
