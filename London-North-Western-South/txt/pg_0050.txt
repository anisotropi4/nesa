       Giving Up a T3 Around a Train Rule Book T3 Section 7
       and Handbook 11 Section 12.2
       It is not permitted to give up a T3 possession around an engineering train(s) or OTM(s) that does not reliably
       work track circuits. If a technical problem means it will no longer operate track circuits reliably, the PICOP
       must contact the controlling signalbox or workstation. The PICOP must arrange for the train(s) or OTM(s) to
       exit the possession site at caution before giving up the T3 possession, and ensure the signaller is made aware
       that the train(s) or OTM(s) will no longer reliably work track circuits.

       High Output Ballast Cleaner (HOBC) and Track Relaying
       Systems (TRS) Trains
       These trains are authorised to transit between their operating bases and engineering possessions in excess of the normal
       route length limits provided that a suitable train path has been identified.
       The train identification used and maximum lengths (including locomotives) are as follows:
       HOBC 6Y07 or 6Y15
                     127 SLUs / 811 metres / 887 yards / 2659 feet
       MOBC 6Y19     105 SLUs / 670 metres / 733 yards / 2198 feet
       TRS 6X01 or 6X04
                     117 SLUs / 744 metres / 813 yards / 2439 feet
       The HOBC and TRS may also exceed the maximum permitted single engine load between the locations listed below. In
       these circumstances the train concerned must operate with a locomotive at each end. The rear loco is authorised to apply
       power as directed by the lead driver to assist as required in the negotiation of inclines between the mileages shown. In
       these cases both locomotives must be manned as per Train Company manning agreements and equipped with back to
       back radios.
       Rule Book, Module TW1, Section 15.1 is modified accordingly.

       IDLING OF DIESEL ENGINES AND CONTROL OF NOISE
       To minimise noise nuisance and to avoid the waste of fuel, Drivers must shut down engines in accordance with the
       following instructions:-
       1.When standing time is likely to exceed FIVE minutes for a locomotive or multiple unit, or FIFTEEN minutes for an
         HST, ALL engines must be shut down on arrival (or completion of shunting or other work) at stations, depots, sidings
         or loops where the train is to be detained.
       2.Exceptions to this instruction are:
         3.During extremely cold weather, when the minimum necessary number of engines may be kept running to
           maintain acceptable interior heat levels.
         4.During extremely hot weather, when the minimum necessary number of engines may be kept running to maintain
           sufficient air conditioning.
         5.When specified in Driver's diagrams.
         6.Certain classes of locomotive as specified in driving instructions e.g. Class 59.
       3.Drivers must not restart engines earlier than is necessary to ensure a punctual departure.
       4.At the locations listed in the following table, Drivers must take special care to comply with the above instructions and
         to avoid sounding the horn other than when it is strictly necessary:
