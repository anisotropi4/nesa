Traincrews booking on duty at Didcot to relieve trains there must obtain instructions from the Movements Supervisor.
Traincrews of incoming services must report to the Movements Supervisor immediately on arrival.
When the train to be relieved is about 20 minutes away, the Signaller will advise the Movements Supervisor that it is
approaching and on which line it will arrive. Traincrews must proceed towards their train in good time so that no delays
take place in effecting relief.
*        Special Arrangements - Up Avoiding Line
1.       Trains must stop with the cab door alongside the relieving platform. Signal SB922 will be maintained at danger.
2.       The Signaller must be advised that the train is ready to proceed by the Driver working it forward, when the Driver
         is satisfied that the crew having relief has crossed clear of the foot crossing.
3.       In the event that a train requiring relief approaches Signal SB922 when it is displaying a proceed aspect,
         traincrew must be aware that the crossing lights will be unable to give warning of a Down train approaching and
         the crossing must NOT be used until:-
         (a) If relieving crew has already arrived at the relief platform
         The Driver being relieved must wait for the train to depart and the crossing lights to return to operation before
         crossing.
         (b) If relieving crew has NOT arrived at the relief platform
         The Driver being relieved must arrange with the Signaller for Signal SB922 to be restored to danger so that the
         crossing lights can return to operation before the relieving crew may cross. The Driver working the train forward
         must advise the Signaller when the train is ready to proceed in accordance with paragraph 2 above.
4.       If the crossing lights are faulty or disconnected, arrangements must be made for Up trains to relieved elsewhere.
