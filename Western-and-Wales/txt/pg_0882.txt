5. Train or vehicles proceeding without authority (including a SPAD) or train
divided
5.1 Staff becoming aware
If a train or vehicles proceeds without authority or has entered the section without authority or without the correct train staff or
ticket, or the train is running in two or more portions, the signaller must:
•   place or keep the signals at danger
•   if necessary, arrange for train radio messages to be sent
•   if possible, alter the position of points to divert trains and prevent collisions
•   if possible, arrange for the line on which the train or vehicle is proceeding without authority to be cleared
•   take the necessary actions for any level crossings
•   contact the shunter/signaller to get trains stopped
•   take any other possible action to reduce the risk of a collision.
5.2 Making sure the line is clear
The signaller must not allow another train to pass over the portion of line affected, until it has been established that you are
sure the line is not obstructed.
The next train must be signalled normally but the signaller must:
•   tell the driver what has happened
•   instruct the driver to proceed through the section at caution.


6. Tail lamp missing or out
If the signaller becomes aware that a train has a tail lamp missing or out, it must be established that the train is complete.
The signaller must also tell the driver of that train that the tail lamp is missing or out.


7. Allowing an assisting train into an occupied section
7.1 Before allowing an assisting train into the occupied section
The signaller may allow an assisting train to enter an occupied section to:
•   proceed to, and assist, a failed train
•   remove a portion of a divided train
•   remove vehicles that have proceeded without authority.

Before the signaller allows an assisting train to enter the occupied section, the signaller must:
•   get confirmation that, when appropriate, the train staff or ticket is with the failed train
•   record the details in the train register.

The shunter must personally accompany the assisting locomotive.
If a train or portion of a train is been left in the section, the signaller must record the details in the train register.
Unless it is necessary for another traction unit to remove the rear portion, the signaller must make sure the driver keeps the
train staff or ticket until the whole of the train has been removed from the section.
If another traction unit is to remove the rear portion, the signaller must arrange for the train staff or ticket to be kept in a safe
place until the assisting train is ready to enter the section.
7.2 When the section is again clear
When the section has been cleared and another train is to proceed through the section, the signaller must signal this train
normally. However, the signaller must:
•   tell the driver what has happened
•   instruct the driver to proceed through the section at caution.


8. Working by pilotman and modified working
If either the train staff or ticket is lost, a thorough search must be made.
If the ticket is lost, trains must be worked using only the train staff until adequate arrangements can be put in place by the
area operations manager.
If the train staff is lost, working by pilotman must be introduced until it is found or replaced.
When pilot working is in place all communications will be managed between signaller and driver directly.
