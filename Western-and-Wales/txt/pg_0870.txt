In the event of a ‘red’ alarm being received, the signaller at Exeter has instructions to place or maintain signals at danger
to protect the affected area. Operations control will be advised who must arrange for the Earthworks Examiner to attend
site as soon as possible.
A train may be used to examine the line in these circumstances and the driver concerned must carefully observe the track,
cess and lower cliff area, reporting back to the signaller at an agreed location.
Train running on one or both lines may be resumed following the examination of the line, depending on the nature of the
drivers report and in accordance with the special instructions issued to the signaller at Exeter.
                                                                                                            Dated: 01/05/10

TOTNES To Marley Tunnels

Blue “sandstick” boxes are provided in the down cess every quarter mile from 223m 20ch to 227m 00ch.
Inside each box is one “sandstick” complete with a container of sand; a standard carriage key unlocks the box. The sticks
and sand are only for use by train crew or others in an emergency to enable a train to gain adhesion on slippery rail. Once
a “sandstick” has been used the controlling signaller must be advised so that it can be refilled.
                                                                                                            Dated: 05/08/06
