If a train exerts an impact force on the track of 350 kilonewtons or more when passing a site, an alarm is sent to
Operations Control in Swindon, from where arrangements will be made with the appropriate Signaller and the TOC Control
to deal with the train.
The train concerned will normally be stopped specially. Depending on the severity of the impact, the Signaller will instruct
the Driver not to exceed a specified maximum speed until the train/ vehicle can be taken out of service. The ‘alarm levels’
used are as follows:
Level 2 Alarm - freight Trains max. speed 30 mph, other than freight trains 50 mph.
Level 3 Alarm – all trains max. speed 20 mph.
Level 4 Alarm – all trains max speed 10 mph.
Level 1 alarms are warnings only and do not require trains to be stopped.
Operations Control and the appropriate TOC Control will confer as necessary on the arrangements to apply in each case;
generally this will follow the Contingency Plan for the operator concerned.
