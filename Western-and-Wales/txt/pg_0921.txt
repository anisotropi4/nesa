Avonmouth PBA Sidings

The instructions in the Working Manual for Rail Staff, Part 3 (Pink Pages), Section D2 apply to these sidings.
The PiC of any movement due to arrive in the sidings must reach a clear understanding with the PiC of any movement
already taking place in the sidings.
The PiC must operate the acceptance plunger to allow the St Andrews Junction signaller to set a route for a movement
arriving in the sidings.
Intrinsically safe hand lamps for use in the siding are located in the Shunters' Cabin and must be returned after use.
Propelled movements over the AVI weighing area must not exceed a speed of 3 mph.
Controlling movements
The communications procedure in Rule Book Module G1 applies to all communication between PiC (call sign Rail PiC)
and driver (call sign Rail driver).
The PiC and driver must test the radio equipment so that both roles can send and receive radio messages, before making
any movement. If the radio equipment is not working, the movement must be controlled by hand signals.
If there is a break in transmission, the driver must stop immediately and restart only when communication by radio is
available again, or the movement can be controlled by hand signals.
When shunting is finished, the driver must return the radio set to the PiC.

All instructions must be acknowledged and must be preceded by the "call sign" notified by the Person in Charge at BBHT.
RADIO DISCIPLINE MUST BE MAINTAINED AT ALL TIMES.
