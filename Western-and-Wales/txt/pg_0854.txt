                               Western Route Sectional Appendix Module WR2

Down goods trains, light locomotives or ECS movements may be signalled reversibly from signal SW1149 via the Up main
line between South Marston and Swindon Up Yard, provided a PiC is on duty and under the following circumstances:
when a train would be too long to be dealt with on the down side at Swindon
where published in the working timetable
in other exceptional circumstances.
A 15 minute margin must be selected to cater for movements starting from SW1149 and to being in clear at Swindon Up
Yard.
The signaller must prevent any movement on the Down Main line that could parallel it by keeping signals SW1149 and
SW1196 at danger until the train concerned has passed clear of track section VYC.
Departing Trains
For trains departing from the West End, the PiC will present the train at SW6521 or SW6523. The driver will contact the
signaller to advise the headcode and location of the train.
For trains departing from the East End, the PIC will present the train at SW6512. The driver will contact the signaller to
advise the headcode and location of the train.
Shunting movements – station area. The following is a list of preferred shunting routes that will be used where more than
one route is available
Where only one shunting route is available, or where due to the nature of the location, liaison between the Signaller and
the Driver always precedes any movement, no preferred shunting route is listed.
Where a shunt is not listed, the Driver and Signaller must reach a clear understanding as to the limits of the movement
and the signals at which the train will reverse behind

Wootton Bassett Carrier Wire Neutral Section (CWNS)
The Carrier Wire Neutral Section (CWNS) at Wootton Bassett consists of a series of dead overhead line wire overlaps that
enable trains to transition from one feeding area to another unhindered. The average length of the arrangement is 300m.
Additional signage is provided to aid drivers transitioning through the section as to where the start and end of the neutral
section occurs.
When cautioning trains from SW1242 (UM) Up direction or SW1237 (UM Down direction), SW1235 (DM), drivers should
be reminded of the presence of the CWNS to ensure a sufficient speed is obtained throughout in order to prevent the
stranding of trains.
