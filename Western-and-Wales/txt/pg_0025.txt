Rule Book Module S7 - Observing and obeying
signalling indications, Train warning systems, Reporting
signalling failures and irregularities
Section 5 â€“ Automatic warnng system (AWS)
AWS track equipment located ahead of a signal
The Driver must be prepared for the possibility that if the signal changes from yellow to green after the front of the train
has passed it, a clear indication (bell) may be received on the AWS equipment even though when he saw the signal it was
yellow.
AWS track equipment on single and bi-directional lines
If a movement that had been signalled onto a single or a bi-directional line then returns towards that location as an
unsignalled movement, AWS inductors will usually remain suppressed for the return movement.
A Driver making such a move must therefore expect to receive no AWS indication at any signal or permissible speed
warning indicator during the return journey, and must not report such instances as failures or irregularities.

must be expected to extend up to approximately 20 metres beyond the signal at danger to which they apply.
