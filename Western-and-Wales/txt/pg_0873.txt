Permissive working
Permissive working involving HST’s, or 8-or-more car Voyagers, charter trains, loco hauled stock incl. sleepers, and steam
trains is prohibited. If you are unsure of a train’s applicability to this criteria, then the permissive move must NOT be
authorised.
This applies to permissive working in all platforms.

A ‘Platform Splitting Sign’ is a rectangular board with white background, two smaller black rectangular markers (to denote
the splitting arrangement) and IET specific alpha/numeric characters in black font.




These boards are located on platforms 4, 5, 7 & 8. They are positioned halfway along the platform and are applicable to
5-car IET’s that are scheduled to join to other services of the same traction type. These boards apply to trains travelling
in either direction.
 Drivers of IET’s not scheduled to join to other IET’s must pass these signs (in the direction of travel) and stop at the
appropriate IET Platform Stop Marker, which has been provided at the far end of each platform.
