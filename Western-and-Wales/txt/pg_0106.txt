6.     Faults and failures – categories

       Failures of the ATP system are categorised into three levels. These are:-

       Level 1                     “Wrong Side” failure where no speed target is displayed under restrictive
                                   circumstances, or where the target speed displayed is higher than it should be, or
                                   where a “SPD” indication shows in the main cab display window when approaching a
                                   signal displaying a proceed aspect.
       Level 2                     “Right Side” failures - non recoverable fault affecting trainborne equipment. These are
                                   identified by an alpha-numeric code in the main cab display window.
       Level 3                     “Right Side” - recoverable failures of lineside equipment identified by an alpha-numeric
                                   code in the main cab display window.
                                   (see Driver’s Manual for full explanation of fault codes).

7.     Faults and failures - immediate actions

       In the event of any fault or failure being apparent affecting ATP equipment, suitable action must be taken as shown in
       the following table. All concerned must ensure that the correct FAULT CATEGORY, as defined in Clause 6, is quoted
       on each occasion.
     LEVEL 1                                                    LEVEL 2                      LEVEL 3

     Control(s) and Control.                                    Signaller tells              the Heathrow Branch.

     track equipment has been reported in order.
* Signallers must treat all FGW HSTs and Class 180s plus all EMU trains as “ATP-fitted for the purposes of this
instruction.
Faults and failures affecting ATP equipment must be reported fully and promptly. Failure to do so may cause essential
equipment performance data to be lost. Reporting of LEVEL 1 faults to the Signaller ensures that subsequent Drivers are
told that the ATP may be unreliable at a specific location. It will also ensure that the on-train equipment is investigated
without delay.
8.     Faults and failures - subsequent actions

       Drivers must complete an ATP Report Form at the end of the journey (or when relieved if sooner) as shown below,
       whether or not they had previously reported the fault verbally as instructed in Clause 7.

9.     Speed Restrictions

       (a) Temporary Speed Restrictions

       When a temporary speed restriction (TSR) is imposed, the ATP track equipment will be adjusted so as to provide full
       supervision of speed to accord with the restriction. This adjustment must be made at the same time as the lineside
       equipment and other arrangements are introduced as set out in the Rule Book.
