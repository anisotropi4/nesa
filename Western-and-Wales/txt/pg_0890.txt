GW185 - MAIDENHEAD TO MARLOW
BOURNE END To MARLOW

Train Failure. If assistance is to be provided from Bourne End, the Driver must take the train staff there in order that the
Person in Charge (or Conductor of the assisting train when Bourne End is unstaffed) can operate the Ground Switch
Panel for the assisting train. The train staff must be handed to the Driver of the assisting train and they must then be
conducted to the disabled train.
AWS arrangements. The single AWS indication for Up trains approaching Bourne End at 0m 43ch applies to the following
signs:
Advance warning sign for Marina and Brooksby ABCL level crossings
Up direction fixed distant signal
Brooksby and Marina Level Crossing (ABCL) – One set of warning boards, speed restriction boards and drivers indicator
lights cover both crossings. The instructions for ABCL / AOCL level crossings in Rule Book, Module TS9, regulation 4
apply at these crossings with the following modifications :
These crossings are operated by approaching trains or the operation of the Drivers plunger. One plunger is provided each
side which covers the operation of both crossings.
In the event of the crossing sequence not being initiated by the approach of the train or should the white light stop flashing
before the train reaches the crossing, the Driver must operate the plunger provided in a locked cabinet (opened by a No. 1
key) just on the approach to the white light post to activate the crossing. When the light is flashing the driver may proceed
over both crossings as normal.
If after the operation of the plunger the white light still does not flash, the Driver must treat the crossings as failed.
Calcott Lane Level crossing (UWC), 1m 44ch – Between Spade Oak Crossing and Marlow. This crossing is provided with
telephones for the safety of users. The telephones connect users with the signaller at Didcot TVSC Slough workstation.
The signaller will contact drivers by use of the GSM-R radio system in order to establish the position of trains. Drivers
must answer these GSM-R calls when it is safe to do so.
Should the GSM-R system be inoperative for any reason at a time when trains are ‘shut-in’ between Bourne End and
Marlow only, the guard must ring the signaller on arrival of each trip at Bourne End to obtain permission to return towards
Marlow.
