                              Western Route Sectional Appendix Module WR2




Movements over points 933 at Whatley Quarry. Points 933 will self-restore towards the shunting neck if there is an
interruption to either the power supply or a failure of the electronic signalling link.
If it is necessary to make any unsignalled movement over these points to or from the branch, either
    •    a person must be appointed at the points to ensure that the route is correctly set immediately before the
         movement takes place, or
    •    the points must be secured for the branch.
