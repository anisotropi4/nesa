Shunting Indicators. The Shunter in Charge must operate the double-sided white light indicators, by means of the plunger
provided, for all propelling movements from the Friary Single line to the Through Sidings and Embankment Sidings. Such
movements must not be commenced until the indicators are illuminated and must be brought to a stand immediately the
lights are extinguished.
During a failure of the indicators movements must be controlled by handsignals.
Carriage washing machine. After the arrival of a locomotive hauled train on the flushing apron the locomotive must be
detached by the Shunter and disposed of via Plymouth Friary; the Shunter must accompany the locomotive.
Before a movement is made from the flushing apron the senior member of the carriage cleaning team is responsible for
advising the Guard/Shunter that cleaning and servicing has been completed.
