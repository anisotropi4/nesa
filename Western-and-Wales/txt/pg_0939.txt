Chipping Sodbury Tunnel

If train radio coverage through the tunnel is not available, drivers will be told by a berth triggered broadcast call.
In the event of a train accident or train evacuation, drivers must carry out the instructions in rule book module M1 / 2.1.
Telephones
Emergency telephones connected to the Stoke Gifford work station signaller are provided in refuges on the up side of the
line every 20 chains from the Paddington end (telephone 10, 101m 20ch) to the Bristol end (telephone 1, 103m 40ch).
Lighting is provided together with identification plates showing the nearest tunnel portal (e.g. TELE 7E – east end).
In an emergency, the signaller must be told about the circumstances immediately, using the nearest telephone (including
whether or not the opposite line is affected).
Staff patrolling the track must test each telephone by calling the signaller, indicating the number of the telephone being
used and making sure that the telephone is working correctly. The signaller must be told about any failure of a telephone
or associated refuge lighting.
Trains stopped in tunnel by train accident or other cause
Passenger trains must not be divided in the tunnel, except in the case of fire or derailment.
Engineering trains and hand trolleys
An engineering train must not be stopped in the tunnel other than when the arrangements are published in the Weekly
Operating Notice (Section B - engineering arrangements) or authorised by the Network Rail Area Operations Manager in
an emergency.
The use of a hand trolley in the tunnel is prohibited other than during possession of the line concerned.
An inspection train may stop in the tunnel on the engineer's order, but before the train enters the tunnel the guard must tell
the signaller.
Flooding
The line between Badminton and Chipping Sodbury (including Chipping Sodbury Tunnel) is liable to flooding.
During heavy rain the track section manager must arrange for competent staff to attend vulnerable sites and report to the
signaller so that the instructions in rule book M3 (so far as they apply to flooding and train running) may be complied with.
