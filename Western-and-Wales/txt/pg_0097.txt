High Output Ballast Cleaner (HOBC) and Track Relaying

These trains are authorised to transit between their operating bases and engineering possessions in excess of
the normal route length limits on Western and Wales Routes provided that a suitable train path has been
identified.
The train identification used and maximum lengths (including locomotives) are as follows:
HOBC            6Y07 or 6Y15    127 SLUs        811 metres       887 yards        2659 feet

inclines between the mileages shown. In these cases both locomotives must be manned as per Train
Company manning agreements and equipped with back to back radios.
