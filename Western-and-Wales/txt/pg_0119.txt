Western Route Sectional Appendix Module WR1




STANDARD SPEED RESTRICTIONS
When trains are running late, Drivers must endeavour to make up time, with due regard to the braking power of the
locomotive and train and provided all speed restrictions are strictly complied with and the maximum speeds indicated are
not exceeded.
Except where shown otherwise in Table A, trains must not exceed the speeds set out below:

                                                                                                Speed mph
 1.    On double lines when passing through junctions between parallel lines or
       through crossover roads, or when entering or leaving Relief, Goods lines or         15
       Loops, Locomotive, Carriage, Platform or Bay lines
 2.    On Single lines when passing through Loop Connections                               15
 3.    When passing over Goods Lines or Loops on which Permissive Working
                                                                                           15
       applies



                           LOCOMOTIVE HAULED TRAINS – MAXIMUM PERMITTED SPEED
Where the Permissible Speed shown in Table A of this Appendix is 100 mph or more, locomotive hauled trains worked by
other than Class 67 locomotives must not exceed 95 mph at any point, except on the Main lines between Acton (4m 40ch)
and Reading (35m 60ch).
Class 67 hauled trains may run up to a maximum speed of 110 mph, where permissible speed shown in Table A of this
Sectional Appendix allows.
These restrictions are due to signal spacing




       TRAINS NOT FITTED WITH AUTOMATIC TRAIN PROTECTION (ATP) – MAXIMUM PERMITTED SPEED
Trains not fitted with ATP may travel at permissible speeds between Reading West Junction and Didcot East Junction on
the main lines. Over all other sections of line shown in Table A of this Sectional Appendix as being ATP fitted, the
maximum speed for all trains not fitted with ATP must not exceed 110 mph at any point.
This restriction is due to design limits of TPWS lineside equipment for trains fitted only with that system.




                                                                                   Western Route GI - Dated: 26/08/17
