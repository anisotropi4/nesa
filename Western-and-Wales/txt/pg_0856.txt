Up Siding Ground Frame – Method of Operation

The ground frame operator must obtain permission from the signaller to operate the ground frame. When permission has
been given, the "Free" button must be pressed to release the ground frame. A check must then be made to ensure the
indicator for track circuit ‘VNS’ is showing ‘track clear’ The 'N' and 'R' buttons may then be operated as required.

If one of these buttons fails to become illuminated the operator must advise the signaller. If the 'N' or 'R' push button fails
to become illuminated no movement must be made over the points until they have been clipped or the button becomes
illuminated.

Before leaving the ground frame the Operator must press the "close" button and advise the Signaller.
