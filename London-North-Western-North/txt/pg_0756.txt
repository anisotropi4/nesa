Handbook RS/521 – Signals, handsignals, indicators and
signs
Section 3, Clause 3.4 - Semaphore subsidiary signals
At certain locations a subsidiary warning signal distinguished by a letter “W” is provided.
When cleared, a warning signal authorises the driver to proceed as far as the next stop signal. The clearing of a warning
signal placed below the section signal must be taken as an indication that the section is clear only to the home signal of
the signal box in advance and drivers must regulate their train speed accordingly.
