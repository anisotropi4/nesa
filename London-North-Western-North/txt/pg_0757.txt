the case of a train requiring to proceed in the down direction) or the signaller at Buxton signal box (in the case of a train
requiring to proceed in the up direction) must be advised by telephone.

2.   Turn the token in an anti-clockwise direction.
3.   When the needles in both the indicators are deflected (this takes place when both signallersâ€™ hold down their
     respective tapper keys), continue turning the token and withdraw it.
