7. Procedure in case of fire.
7.1 Any outbreak of fire on or near to the electrified lines must be reported immediately to the ECO.
7.2 In reporting fire, care must be taken to state the exact location and which line(s) is affected.
7.3 Urgent measures must be taken to extinguish fires likely to affect cables or other electrical equipment. The local
instructions regarding procedure in case of fire contained in the Local Information Card must also be carried out.
7.4 B.C.F. extinguishers painted yellow or with a yellow band are suitable for use on fires on, or in the immediate vicinity of,
electrified lines, cables or train equipment which may be alive.
ANY EMPLOYEE INHALING OR COMING INTO CONTACT WITH THE VAPOUR FROM B.C.F. EXTINGUISHERS MUST
IMMEDIATELY BE PLACED IN FRESH AIR AND, IF B.C.F. ENTERS THE EYES, THEY MUST BE FLUSHED WITH
CLEAN WATER.
A.F.F.F. Spray Extinguishers painted beige, must not be directed at live electrical equipment, including overhead line
equipment, conductor rails or electric train heating equipment UNTIL THE ELECTRICITY HAS BEEN SWITCHED OFF.
Exception: A.F.F.F. extinguishers may be directed at train/traction electrical equipment BUT ONLY after the electric train
supply (E.T.S.) and/or main traction supply has been switched off.
Battery circuits may remain energised in order to retain emergency train lighting and communication equipment.
7.5 Dry sand or earth is suitable for extinguishing fires, but water or extinguishers containing water must NOT be used
under any circumstances until electricity has been switched off from the vicinity of the fire. Even then water must not be
used if other means of extinguishing the fire are available
8. Damage to conductor rails and cables.
When damage, smoking, excessive flashing (except normal sparking caused by a passing electric train), or fusing is
noticed, the matter must be reported immediately by telephone to the ECO, starting the location and which line(s) is
affected.
9. Interference with electrical equipment.
All staff must exercise vigilance to prevent interference with any portion of electrical equipment.
10. Flooding of permanent way.

10.1 Whenever an electrified line is flooded up to the tops of sleepers, any person observing or becoming aware of such
flooding must arrange for the ECO to be at once informed, reporting the location, depth and extent of flooding and any
subsequent change of conditions.
10.2 All concerned are warned that when flood water is lying on the surface of the permanent way, they must take care not
to step into the water, as it may be highly charged with electricity.
10.3 Where circumstances arise causing it to be necessary for any person to step into the water, the conductor rail must be
isolated before he does so.
11. Wagon sheets.

Great care must be exercised in securing sheets on wagons routed over electrified lines so as to prevent the sheets being
dislodged by wind. Sheet strings must not be allowed to hang loosely.

12. Securing of couplings and brake pins.

12.1 Guards and shunters working trains passing over electrified lines must see that brake pins or long couplings are not
allowed to hang down. The attention of maintenance staff must be called to all brake levers which are found to be less than
six inches from the rail level when in their lowest position. Guards and shunters are responsible for walking round their train
to see that all is in order in this respect prior to leaving the last depot or yard before they pass over electrified lines. The
middle link of loose couplings must be pushed up in order to clear the conductor rail.

12.2 Drivers are responsible for seeing that screw couplings attached to their locomotives are clear of the conductor rails.

12.3 Train staff when pinning or unpinning handbrakes, coupling or uncoupling vehicles, etc., must as far as practicable,
work on the side of the vehicles at which there is no conductor rail.
