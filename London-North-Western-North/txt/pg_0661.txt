Peak Forest South Long Sidings

Method of Working for Banking Locomotives from Cemex Dove Holes Quarry
Peak Forest Long Sidings are situated on a 1 in 90 gradient climbing towards Peak Forest South. For heavy freight trains,
a rear assisting locomotive in the form of a ‘banking’ locomotive may be required.


If a rear assisting banking locomotive is not available, then a number of wagons must be removed from the train prior to
departure from Cemex Dove Holes Quarry. Wagons must not be detached in either Long Sidings unless the train has
failed as outlined below.
If a wagon set requiring banking assistance is stabled in Long Siding No.1 and the identified assisting locomotive is
required back in Cemex Dove Holes Quarry for shunting operations, Long Siding No.2 must be kept clear to allow the
assisting locomotive to return to the rear of the wagon set prior to its departure.
If the rear assisting banking locomotive fails whilst banking and the leading locomotive is unable to haul the train forward,
then a number of wagons must be detached from the wagon set in Long Sidings prior to the train continuing forward. A
rescue locomotive must be sourced from Cemex Dove Holes Quarry to assist the remaining wagons and failed banking
locomotive back into the Quarry.
