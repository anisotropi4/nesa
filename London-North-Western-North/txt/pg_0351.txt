Vehicles placed in the up siding must whenever possible be placed beyond the board lettered '9 feet clearance'.
Vehicles must not be stabled on the down siding for any purpose other than running round or proceeding to the quarry.
A block train of empty wagons for the quarry must be drawn into the reception sidings and brought to a stand clear of the
connection to the private siding. The person in charge of the movement (PIC) must then request permission from the
quarry staff, using the telephone at the ‘Stop & Telephone’ board, for the movement to enter the private siding.
Before giving permission for the movement to proceed, the quarry staff will ensure that the road barrier is lowered and
locked and that the siding is clear. The PIC will then be handed two shunting radios and cards of instructions and the key
to the road barrier. One of the radio handsets and card of instructions must be handed to the driver.
When permission has been given for the movement to proceed, the train may propel into the siding for loading, all
movements being controlled by radio on instruction from the quarry staff.
On completion of loading, the train must return to the reception sidings and the guard must return the radios, cards of
instructions and road barrier key to the quarry staff in the weighbridge office.
