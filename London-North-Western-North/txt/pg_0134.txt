       Fiddlers Ferry Power Station SB

       Fiddlers Ferry FGD (Flue Gas Discharge) site
       The FGD site consists of a Loading Line, Engine Release Line and a Cripple Siding which are an extension of the Cripple
       Siding Line at Fiddlers Ferry Signal box. An FGD site Person In Charge (PIC) is appointed by the Fiddlers Ferry signaller.
       The FGD site PIC is responsible for authorising all movements within the FGD site and any movements into it.
       Method of working
       Provided that PIC status has not already been granted, the Fiddlers Ferry signaller may signal one movement into the site.
       The Shunter, or Driver of an unaccompanied movement, must contact the signaller and be granted the FGD site PIC
       status. The signaller will give the FGD site PIC details of any vehicles within the FGD site. No further movements into the
       FGD site must be made until permission has been obtained from the FGD site PIC.
       If a traction unit or vehicles are stabled in the FGD site, the Designated Person, Shunter, or Driver of an unaccompanied
       movement, must first contact the Fiddlers Ferry signaller and either become the FGD site PIC or get authority from an
       existing FGD site PIC before making any movements.
       On leaving the FGD site, the PIC must contact the Fiddlers Ferry signaller and give up their FGD site PIC status. They
       must give the signaller details of any vehicles left in the FGD site.
