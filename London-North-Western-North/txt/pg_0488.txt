Shunting:
Opposed locking is omitted for signals MC7622 and MC7621 only. When this facility is in use, the route is set and locked
between Trafford Park Freightliner Terminal and the Platform Line to allow continuous movements to take place without
signaller interaction. The PIC must contact the Signaller to request this set up utilising the Shunters Release SR MC2606
before conducting any movements. The PIC must contact the Signaller once all moves are completed and request the
opposed locking facility to be cancelled.
Signal MC7620 situated on the Platform Line can be cleared to allow shunting movements onto the Up CLC line. Signal
MC7620 may be cleared simultaneously with the opposed locking omitted between signals MC7622 and MC7621.
‘OFF’ indicators are provided for signal MC7621 to provide visual confirmation to the Driver that signal MC7621 has
cleared towards the Terminal. An ‘OFF’ indicator for MC7621 is situated on Bridge 220 and ‘OFF’ indicators are
positioned along the cess of the Up CLC line. These ‘OFF’ indicators will only illuminate when the route is set from the
Platform Line onto the Up CLC line via points 604A/B in the reverse position. The ‘OFF’ indicators will not illuminate when
points 604A/B are in the normal position.
