GSM-R GENERAL INSTRUCTION
TW5 SECTION 25 – KNOWN SEARCHING NETWORK LOCATIONS
The locations in the table below have encountered a temporary reduction in radio coverage with the GSM-R
system which may result in registration problems and the ability of the driver to contact the signaller. This will
be presented to the Driver on the DCP as ‘searching for network’.

Drivers must carry out the 'Pending Registration' process on the radio and continue their journey.

TW5 Section 24 - Known Misrouted Call Locations

The locations in the table below are known areas where calls are frequently misrouted to the wrong signaller.
Calls may misroute to the wrong signaller if the ‘contact signaller’ button is pressed.

Drivers are instructed to use the phone book to contact the signaller from these locations.

                                                                                    and repaired.

LIMITED COVERAGE ON FREIGHT ONLY BRANCH LINES

The freight-only branch lines listed in the table below are sections of permanent poor GSM-R coverage. These
areas of poor coverage are in tunnels and deep cuttings resulting in GSM-R calls may be unreliable, as with
previous NRN coverage. If a train is in a poor coverage area at the time the emergency call is initiated, the
train radio will receive the emergency call as soon as there is sufficient GSM-R coverage.
