Rule Book Module P1, Section 5, Clause 5.2. When single line working is in operation, the signaller at Buxton signal box is

Servicing of Northern Trains units stabled at Buxton Station
A Designated Person (DP) must be appointed when servicing on Northern Trains vehicles is undertaken within the station
area at Buxton station. Before allowing any work to commence, the Designated Person must reach a clear understanding
with the Signaller at Buxton signal box on the nature of the work to be undertaken and ensure that a ‘NOT TO BE MOVED’
board is provided on the leading end of any vehicle stabled on the Middle Road.
The Signaller at Buxton signal box must, when satisfied it is safe to do so, give permission to the Designated Person to
secure 12b points in the Normal position. The Designated Person must confirm to the Signaller when 12b points have
been secured in the Normal position.
Once the Signaller has made a suitable entry in the Train Register Book, then authority may be given by the Signaller to
the Designated Person for work to commence.
When all work is complete and movements may resume in the Middle Siding, the Designated Person must remove the
‘NOT TO BE MOVED’ boards from any stabled vehicles in the Middle Siding and confirm to the Signaller that all work has
been completed.
The Signaller, when satisfied it is safe to do so, will authorise the Designated Person to release 12b points. The
Designated Person must confirm to the Signaller when this has been done.
Normal working may then be resumed.
