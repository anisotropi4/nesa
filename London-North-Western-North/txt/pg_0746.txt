Rule Book Module TS1 – General signalling regulations
Section 8 – Ground Frames
1. Unlocking the ground frame from the signal box
The ground frame operator must telephone the signaller and come to a clear understanding regarding the movements to
be made before requesting that the ground frame be unlocked. The signaller must inform the ground frame operator when
the frame has been unlocked. Where a plunger working in connection with a release lever at the ground frame is provided,
it must be pressed and held in until the lever is out of the catch.
2. Relocking the ground frame once movements are complete
The ground frame operator must inform the signaller that the ground frame can be relocked once:
•   all movements have been completed, and the train is clear of the points ready to depart or has been shunted into the
    siding(s) clear of the running line(s), and,
•   all ground frame levers have been replaced in the normal position.
The signaller must inform the ground frame operator when the ground frame has been relocked. Until this advice is
received, the ground frame operator must not rejoin the train or allow it to proceed.
3. Ground frame bell codes
At ground frames where separate telephone ringing facilities are not provided, the ‘Attend Telephone’ bell code 3-3-3-3
must be used by the person requiring to speak to the signaller or vice versa.
At ground frames, where bell communication is also provided with the signal box, the following codes must be used if
there is a failure of the telephone. (The call attention signal, 1 beat, must be sent and acknowledged before the required
code is sent.)
To signal box
•   Unlock ground frame .................................................................................................................. 2
•   Train shunted clear of running line(s) - Lock ground frame ........................................................ 3
•   Train on running line ready to depart - Lock ground frame ........................................................ 5
(These codes must be acknowledged by repetition when the ground frame has been unlocked/locked).
•   Running line(s) fouled ................................................................................................................ 6
From signal box
•   Clear running lines for train to pass ............................................................................................ 7
(To be acknowledged by repetition and the bell code 3 sent when the line(s) have been cleared).
4. Mishaps or incidents during shunting
If the ground frame operator observes any irregularity on the running lines or should a running line be fouled, the signaller
must be advised immediately. Where bell communication is provided, in order to obtain the signallers’ attention without
delay, six or more beats on the bell must be given in rapid succession. The ground frame operator must also carry out
whatever emergency protection is required in accordance with the Rule Book.
5. If unable to relock the ground frame
Should the signaller be unable to relock the ground frame and special emergency instructions not be in force, a following
train must not be allowed to proceed until an assurance has been received that the points have been firmly secured in the
normal position or the failure has been rectified.
6. Ground frame unlocked by Annett’s key taken from the signal box
The key must be inserted in the lock provided on the ground frame lever to release it. The key will be locked in the lever
until it is restored to the normal position. The Annett’s key must be returned to the signal box when the work has been
completed.
