     Table D5B – Locomotive Gauge Clearance Table
                                                                                     Last Updated: 28/04/2019
     To be read in conjunction with General Notes.
     • All locomotives conform to locomotive gauge, apart from Class 37s (when fitted with roof horns).
     • Locomotive gauge restrictions apply to all locomotives unless clearance is provided in the Route Clearance D4 Tables.
     • Locomotives that are not listed in the Route Clearance D4 Tables are permitted to operate over routes that conform to locomotive gauge, subject to the restrictions detailed in the table
       below and the conditions stated in the locomotive's Summary of Compatibility document. Locomotives that are not listed in the Route Clearance D4 Tables require a valid Summary of
       Compatibility prior to operation over Network Rail infrastructure.
     • Locomotives are PROHIBITED from using crossovers within platforms (code word LACER) unless their overall length (over buffers) is 18.288m or less.
     • Gauge clearance for steam locomotives is considered under a separate process.
     The notations (used in these tables) are explained as follows for locomotive gauge conformant vehicles:
     Y   Route conforms to locomotive gauge without restriction.
     R   Route conforms (or partly conforms) to locomotive gauge but restrictions apply. See “Notes” column for details.
     N   Route does not conform to locomotive gauge
