Rule Book Module T3 - Possession of a running line for
engineering work
Stabling and out-berthing of trains formed of empty coaching stock (ECS) on a bay or dead-end
platform line

NOTE : these arrangements may be applied when it is necessary to block a line as shown in handbook 8 – IWA, COSS or
PC blocking a line.
Trains formed of empty coaching stock (ECS) may be stabled or out-berthed on the platform lines shown below if
necessary during possession of the line for engineering work or a line blockage.
    1.      Llandudno Jn, platform 2
    2.      Holyhead, platforms 1, 2 and 3
Metal tools and equipment must not be placed any closer than 2 metres from axle counter equipment.
Work on signalling equipment which detects the train(s) on the platform line(s) concerned is prohibited.
If it is necessary (for testing purposes) to operate a signal, which when cleared, will allow a train to leave a bay or dead-
end platform line which is included in the possession (line blockage) arrangements, the PICOP (COSS) must arrange for
not to be moved board(s) to be attached to the train(s) affected. The not to be moved board(s) must remain attached to
any train(s) affected during the time that the signalling equipment tested. This activity is allowed on all platform lines listed
above.
Use of a hand trolley (Handbook 10 – Duties of the COSS or SWL and person in charge when using a hand trolley) must
not proceed closer than 2 metres short of the train at the affected platform and is allowed on all platform lines listed above.
Use of OTM/OTP on a platform line which is occupied by a train during the possession is prohibited.
