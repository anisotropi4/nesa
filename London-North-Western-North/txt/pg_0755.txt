LNW North Route Sectional Appendix Module NW9



If a rear assisting banking locomotive is not available, then a number of wagons must be removed from the train prior to
departure from Cemex Dove Holes Quarry. Wagons must not be detached in either Long Sidings unless the train has
failed as outlined below.
If a wagon set requiring banking assistance is stabled in Long Siding No.1 and the identified assisting locomotive is
required back in Cemex Dove Holes Quarry for shunting operations, Long Siding No.2 must be kept clear to allow the
assisting locomotive to return to the rear of the wagon set prior to its departure.
If the rear assisting banking locomotive fails whilst banking and the leading locomotive is unable to haul the train forward,
then a number of wagons must be detached from the wagon set in Long Sidings prior to the train continuing forward. A
rescue locomotive must be sourced from Cemex Dove Holes Quarry to assist the remaining wagons and failed banking
locomotive back into the Quarry.
Trains departing Long Sidings with Banking Assistance
Upon arrival, the rear banking locomotive will be detached. Once the leading locomotive has been attached to the wagon
set, a brake test will be carried out to prove air continuity throughout the set.
Once the brake test has been completed and lead locomotive pre-checks have been completed, the lead locomotive
Driver will establish radio communication with the Driver of the rear assisting banking locomotive via GSM-R cab-to-cab
radio, or via two-way radio.
The lead locomotive Driver will contact the signaller at Peak Forest South signal box via GSM-R and advise that they are
ready to depart.
The lead locomotive Driver will contact the Driver of the rear assisting banking locomotive via GSM-R or two-way radio to
advise they are ready to depart and are waiting for signals PF26 and PF19 to be cleared.
Once signals PF26 and PF19 have been cleared, the lead locomotive Driver will contact the Driver of the rear assisting
banking locomotive via GSM-R or two-way radio to advise the signals have been cleared and will grant authority to
commence banking. Both drivers are to apply enough power to ensure that the maximum permitted speed of 15mph upon
exiting Long Sidings is not exceeded.
The Driver of the banking locomotive must come to a stand in the Long Sidings at a position adjacent to PF13/PF17 signal
gantry, which is located on the Down & Up Through Siding. The driver of the banking locomotive must not pass this point.
Once the freight train has fully departed onto the Up Goods line towards Chinley South Jn, the Quarry PIC will contact the
signaller at Peak Forest South SB to request the route is set from signal PF8 into Cemex Dove Holes Quarry for the
banking locomotive. Once signal PF8 has been cleared, the Quarry PIC will grant permission for the Driver of the banking
locomotive to proceed. All signals must be obeyed as normal.
