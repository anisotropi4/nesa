Whilst the train is inside the power station sidings all movements from signal SA to signals S3B and S3C, as well as
signals S7B and S7C, are under the control of the Power Station Controller, who can be contacted by means of the signal
post telephones.
From signals S4B and S4C to signals S14B and S14C the train will be under the control of ‘creep’ signals operated by the
Track Hopper Controller, located in the Hopper House.
Controlled position light signals FF.5 and FF.6, located beneath signals S13B and S13C, are under the control of the
signaller at Fiddlers Ferry Power Station signal box and are provided with signal post telephones. The clearance of ‘creep’

When permission is given by the Track Hopper Controller to enter the Hopper building, the train must be drawn forward at
a speed not exceeding ½ mph, subject to the observance of any 'creep' signal indications on the discharge track, until the
whole of the train is clear of the empty weighbridge.
A series of 'creep' indicators display five horizontal white lights when in the stop position and five vertical white lights in the
proceed position and are positioned to control movements through the discharge area. (In the case of signals S13B and C
and S14B and C, only three horizontal or three vertical white lights are provided). When a stop indication is displayed, the
driver must immediately bring the train to a stand and not run forward to the next signal.
Should it be necessary for a train which has just passed through the Hopper to set-back, a blue letter 'X' will be displayed,
