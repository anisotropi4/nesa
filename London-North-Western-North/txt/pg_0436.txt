       MANCHESTER AIRPORT to Heald Green North Jn

       Between Manchester Airport and Heald Green North and South Junctions
       Airport runway over-run trip wires. Trip wires are provided on both sides of the Up Airport and Down Airport lines,
       between Heald Green West Junction and signal MP265, extending for the width of the flight-path of the Manchester Airport
       main runway. These trip wires will be broken if an aircraft approaches at a dangerously low level when taking off or
       landing and this will have the following effects on railway operations / infrastructure:
       • Signals MP255, MP263, MP261 and MP269 at Manchester Airport will be replaced to danger.
       • Signals MP265, MP271 and MP272 at Heald Green West Junction will be replaced to danger.
       • Routes will be inhibited from signal MP283 to the Down Chord line at Heald Green South Junction and from signal
         MP286 to the Up Airport line at Heald Green North Junction.
       • The electricity supply to the OLE on both lines between Manchester Airport station and Heald Green North Junction
         and both lines between Heald Green West Junction and Heald Green South Junction will be cut off.
       IT MUST NOT BE ASSUMED THAT THE OVERHEAD LINE EQUIPMENT HAS BEEN ISOLATED UNLESS THE
       PROCEDURES SHOWN IN RULE BOOK MODULE AC, SECTIONS 6.1 AND 6.2, HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT.
       If signals MP265, MP271 or MP272 revert to danger as a train approaches, or if it is necessary for a train to be brought to
       a stand between these signals, the driver must try to bring the train to a stand clear of the flight-path.
       Rule Book Module P1. When it is necessary to institute single line working over the Down and Up Airport lines, a
       handsignaller must be appointed opposite signal MP265 and either signal MP271 or MP272. If an aircraft emergency
       occurs, the pilot appointed for single line working will be advised by the signaller at Manchester Piccadilly SCC and must
       arrange for train services to be suspended as soon as possible.
       Working of cranes. In addition to the procedure shown in Rule Book Handbook 16, Section 4.1, cranes must not be
       allowed to work on the Down and Up Airport lines between Heald Green West Junction and signal MP265 unless the
       authority of the Manchester Airport Air Traffic Control Watch Manager (telephone 0161 209 2836) has been obtained. For
       pre-planned work, at least 5 days’ notice must be given to the Watch Manager. If 5 days’ notice cannot be given, the
       authority of the Watch Manager must still be obtained. In an emergency the signaller at Manchester Piccadilly SCC can
       be asked to obtain this authority.
