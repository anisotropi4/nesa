Working of Down (Salop) Sidings. Sidings 1 and 2 are provided to the south of Stafford Station. Siding 1 is provided
with 25kV OLE equipment in its entirety; Siding 2 has no OLE equipment.

Before routing a train into either Siding 1 or Siding 2, the signaller will reach a clear understanding with the driver about
the movement to be made into the sidings. This will include:
•        The limits of the movement
•        Whether the train is electric or diesel traction
•        Whether the driver will be operating the hand points within the sidings.

Where the driver of the train WILL NOT be operating the hand points within the sidings, the signaller will arrange for a
local competent person to operate the hand points on behalf of the driver.

Working of Arrival Lines 1 and 2. Arrival Lines 1 and 2 are provided on the Up Side just south of Stafford Station. A
‘Stop & Contact Signaller’ board (LS4306) is provided at the south end of the Arrivals Lines – this is shared for both Arrival
Lines to access the Arrival Siding Neck.

Before routing a train into either Arrival Line 1 or Arrival Line 2, the signaller will reach a clear understanding with the
driver about the movement to be made into the sidings. This will include:
•        The limits of the movement
•        Whether the driver will be operating the hand points at the south end of the Arrivals Lines.

Where the driver of the train WILL NOT be operating the hand points, the signaller will arrange for a local competent
person to operate the hand points on behalf of the driver.

Stafford and Lichfield Trent Valley - LS1301 and LS1303 duplicate signal numbers. Following the re-signalling of the
Stafford area, there are two pairs of signals with the same identities, one pair at Lichfield Trent Valley, controlled from
Trent Valley Workstation in Rugby SCC, and the other pair at Stafford station, controlled from Stafford Workstation in
Rugby ROC.

To reduce the risk of miscommunication, all persons calling from any of these signals (whether using the signal post
telephone or any other means) or referring to these locations, must state either “Stafford” or “Trent Valley”, as appropriate,
before stating the signal prefix and number when referring to signal LS1301 or LS1303. These instructions also apply to
written records and forms.
The signals will be plated as follows:
•         Stafford LS1301
•         Trent Valley LS1301
•         Stafford LS1303
•         Trent Valley LS1303
