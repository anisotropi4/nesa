                             is normally retained in the lockout device.
                  LOD(K): this type of lockout prevents trains from entering the protected area in both
                             directions, but does not prevent train moves within the area or going out of the
                             area. This is a captive key system where the key is normally retained in the
                             lockout device.

                  LOD(P): this type of lockout prevents signalled train movements from being made in the
                             'wrong' direction, where the line has been signalled for bi-directional working.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                OFFICIAL




                             This is a key enabled system where the authorised user must obtain the key
                             before operation can commence.
                  LOD(T): this type of lockout prevents all signalled moves into the area from being made,
                             but not moves within, or going out of, the protected area. It also prevents moves
                             from being made to signals where the overlap of the route set would be in the
                             protected area. This is a key enabled system where the authorised user must
                             obtain the key before operation can commence.

                  Full details of the protection afforded is as defined in the lineside case.
