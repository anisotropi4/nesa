Rule Book Module T10 - Protecting personnel when
working on rail vehicles and in sidings
Section 1 - Depot
At the following locations, sidings are used for maintenance and repairs or form part of depots. When sidings are in use by
maintenance personnel, the movement of rail vehicles will be under the control of a Designated Person (DP), who is
responsible for arranging protection and who will be identified by an orange arm-band endorsed “DP” in black letters. At
other times, movements will be under the control of operating staff. Movements in sidings used for these arrangements
must not exceed 5 mph.
When maintenance personnel are in the sidings, visitors and staff of other departments/companies must report to the DP
and must not start work until their presence has been recorded and the relevant protection has been provided.
