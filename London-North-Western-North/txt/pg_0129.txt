       LNW North Route Sectional Appendix Module NW2

       To assist in shunting operations, the Halewood Exchange Sidings PIC can request the signaller at MROC Wavertree
       Workstation to set routes between signal DN8101 located on the Halewood East Neck and signal DN8102 located at the
       exit from Halewood Exchange Sidings, to show a proceed aspect at the same time.
       Once the shunting activities have been completed the PIC must advise the signaller at MROC Wavertree Workstation.
       Departing Trains. The PIC will advise the signaller at MROC Wavertree workstation when a train is ready to depart the
       sidings and inform the signaller of the train’s headcode. If the train is too long for the Halewood Reception sidings, the
       signaller will set a route from either signal DN857 or signal DN859 as applicable onto the Down Ditton Slow line to enable
       the train to stand on the approach side of either signal DN856 or signal DN858.
       Note: No movements are allowed beyond Halewood Exchange Sidings gates without a PIC having been previously
       appointed.
       Giving up the role of PIC. The PIC must only give up the role when:
       • All shunting activities have been completed between the closed compound gates and Halewood East Neck buffers and
       the line is clear and safe
       • The train the PIC was responsible for is ready to depart from signal DN858 on Halewood Reception No.1 or signal
       DN856 on Halewood Reception No.2 (with train headcode provided) and the compound gates are closed
       • No other PIC will assume the role
