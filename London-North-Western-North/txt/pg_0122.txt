       Ineos Chlor, high tension cables. Extra high tension cables are laid on the up and down sides of the running lines. The
       cables are laid underground on the up side of the Runcorn Dock branch, crossing under the line behind Runcorn down
       platform. Other cables are attached to the parapet wall of the viaduct and to the main girders of Runcorn bridge on the
       down side.
       These cables are charged with electricity dangerous to life and they must on no account be interfered with.
       If a fire is observed by any member of staff in the vicinity of the cables or anything denoting possible danger to them, the
       signaller at the Manchester ROC, Wavertree Workstation must be advised in order that Ineos Chlor and the Electricity
       Authority may be advised.
       Only sand should be used in dealing with a fire on, or in the vicinity of high tension cables and it must be thrown on from a
       distance so as to avoid contact between the person and the cable or troughing. When an assurance has been received
       from Ineos Chlor, and the Electricity Authority that the cables have been made dead, water may be used to extinguish a
       fire.
