       Modified Working
       In the event of signalling equipment failure on the single lines listed in the table below, modified working may be authorised
       by the Network Rail Route Control Manager, for a period of up to two hours, without introducing working by pilot.
       In exceptional circumstances the period of up to two hours may be extended subject to the agreement of the Network Rail
       Route Control Manager, the Responsible Person and the train / freight operating companies involved.
       Modified working may be introduced providing:
       The signaller is able to work the points giving access to / egress from the single line or they can be set and detected for the
         passage of trains.
       Direct verbal communication is available between all signallers involved and the Responsible Person.
       At the locations listed below, a train is allowed to pass over the single line concerned without working by pilot being
