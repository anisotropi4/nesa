       Rule Book Module TW1 - Preparation and movement of
       trains : General
       Section 28 - Rail-head adhesion
       Manual Application of Sand or Sandite

       If a report is received from a driver or another competent person of poor rail adhesion, Operations Control may arrange for
       an authorised person to apply sand or sandite by means of hand held apparatus, (e.g. ‘sand bomb’ or ‘handite’ machine),
       provided that only a short length of rail head is involved.
       After the sand or sandite has been applied using the appropriate equipment the signaller must take the following action:
       1. Controlled test stop
       A controlled test stop as shown in Rule Book Module TW1, Section 28.2, must be made at the location concerned.
       2. Operation of track circuits
       Following the application of sand or sandite the requirements of Rule Book Module TS1, Section 12, Clauses 12.2, 12.3,
       12.4 and 12.5 (as relevant to the circumstances of the movement) must be observed in respect of the next train or trains
       over the line concerned, until the correct operation of track circuits has been observed.
       3. Autumn leaf fall Initiatives
       If rail head treatment has been applied as part of the Autumn leaf fall initiatives without any report of poor rail head
       adhesion at that location, it will not be necessary for a train to perform a Controlled Test Stop as shown above. The
       person who applies rail head treatment must inform the signaller. Normal working over the treated line must not be
       resumed until the correct operation of track circuits has been observed as detailed in “2. Operation of track circuits” above.
