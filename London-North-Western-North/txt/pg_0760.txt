LNW North Route Sectional Appendix Module NW9




If a PICBS has been appointed from one FOC but another FOC train is ready to be accepted into the sidings without the
FOC shunter being present to deal with the train as long as the line is clear to Stop Board BS2 the PICBS may operate the
shunters release to allow the train to enter Bredbury Sidings. In these circumstances the PICBS must not authorise the
train concerned to proceed beyond Stop Board BS2 until the shunter from the train’s parent company has arrived on site
and a clear understanding has been reached on the arrangements that will apply
Departing Trains or Shunting movements
Before authorising any movement to pass either Stop Board BS1 or BS3 the person authorising the movement must make
certain that the shunters release is in the Normal position and that no train movement has been authorised to approach
into the sidings from Woodley Junction
When a train is ready to depart, the PICBS must advise the signaller at Manchester East SCC of the movement and its
head code before authorising the driver to proceed towards signal RJ37. Unless the departing train requires to run-round
at Woodley, the PICBS must remain on site until the signaller at Manchester East SCC advises that the train has arrived at
signal RJ37 or has proceeded beyond the signal.
There is no requirement to advise the signaller at Manchester East SCC when shunting movements are made ahead of
Stop Boards BS1 or BS3
2.1 Failure of the shunters release
If the shunters release becomes defective the PICBS must advise the signaller at Manchester East SCC of this as soon as
possible. If a train requires to enter or leave the sidings whilst the shunters release is defective the signaller and PICBS
must reach a clear understanding on the movement involved. Before a train is authorised to pass signal RJ34 or Stop
Boards BS1 or BS3 the signaller and PICBS must both confirm that no other conflicting movement has been authorised.
The signaller must record in the Occurrence Book the time when a driver is authorised to pass signal RJ34at danger and
when authority is given to the PICBS for a train to pass Stop Board BS1 or BS3
