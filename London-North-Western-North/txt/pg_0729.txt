    Rule Book Module G1 – General safety responsibilities and
    personal track safety for non track workers
    Section 5 – Communications procedure
    Using GSM-R berth triggered messages and non-verbal acknowledgements to caution drivers.

    Signallers can set up automated messages to caution train drivers for:
    • Poor railhead conditions.
    • Animals on the line (but not inside tunnels).
    • Wheel Impact Load Detector Activations.
    • Defective Emergency indicators.
    • Weather alerts, upon instruction by the Route Control.
    • Unusual events (Not Track or Signalling).
    All trains fitted with GSM-R will receive the broadcast message. Drivers of services not fitted with version 3.5 software do not have
    an ST button so must disregard the GSM-R berth triggered safety broadcast and bring their train to a stand at the protecting signal.
    The berth triggered broadcast may be implemented at all signalling locations, based on the signallers’ local knowledge.
    Methodology
    1.Signaller records the berth triggered safety broadcast to a set script and stores it on the system. The message must be reviewed
      and checked before transmission, whenever possible.
    2.Signaller sets up the berth triggered safety broadcast at the appropriate signal berth(s).
    3.Signaller will maintain the protecting signal at danger with a reminder. This is the signal where the train would be stopped and
      cautioned if the Signaller does not receive the acknowledgement.
    4.The safety broadcast will be made automatically to each train occupying the designated berth(s).
    5.The Driver acknowledges that the safety broadcast has been received and that it has been understood by pressing the GSM-R
      ST Button.
    6.The protecting signal is maintained at danger until the signaller has received an acknowledgement’ (ACK) message from the
      Driver.
    7.When the acknowledgement is received, the signaller may remove the signal reminder and clear the protecting signal for the
      train that sent the acknowledgement
    8.If the acknowledgement message is not received (or the signaller gets a “message failed” or “not sent” alert) the protecting
      signal remains at danger and the train will be stopped and the message passed verbally.
    9.The signaller must replace the reminder on the signalling controls to maintain the protecting signal at danger until the next driver
      has been cautioned.
    10. Train drivers must obey the instructions given by the GSM-R message over the affected section of line.
