Rule Book Module M2 – Train stopped by train failure
Section 1, Clause 1.2 – Telling the signaller, Multiple units coupled in multiple
To assist staff in identifying automatic couplers which could be damaged by coupling the train to another train, a yellow
and black ‘Non Multi’ sign will be fixed to the offside windscreen of the cab concerned so that the sign will be directly
opposite the driver of another train.
During normal working, no attempt should be made to couple an automatic coupler where this sign is shown.
In the event of a train equipped with automatic couplers becoming disabled and requiring assistance, the driver of the
disabled train must, when requesting assistance, specifically advise the signaller whether or not a ‘Non Multi’ sign is
displayed in either of the end cabs of the train. Similarly, the driver of the assisting train, before proceeding towards the
disabled train, must specifically advise the signaller whether or not a ‘Non Multi’ sign is displayed in the cab at the end
which would be coupled to the disabled train.




                             (Black and white example shown. Version in use has a black cross and text on a yellow
background.)
If assistance can only be provided is such a manner that one or other of the cabs to be coupled has a ‘Non-Multi’ sign
displayed, technical advice must be obtained. Under no circumstance should any attempt be made to couple the trains
until this advice is received. Technical authority may be granted to couple the trains using the automatic couplers subject
to conditions which will be specified at the time. If such authority must be granted, it will be necessary to use an
emergency coupling.
