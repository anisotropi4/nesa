       Module T2, Section 8 - Protection procedure T2-A (using a track circuit operating device - T-COD)

       T-COD switches are provided in lockfast cabinets on the Up Kincardine line at either end of the Forth Viaduct. When
       these switches are operated there is no requirement to place a T-COD on the Up Kincardine line. The system may be
       actuated at one cabinet and cancelled at another. The procedure detailed in this section must, in all other respects, be
       followed.

       SC183 - STIRLING TO CHARLESTOWN JN
       Kincardine GSP

       All movements towards / from the Stirling direction requiring the operation of Kincardine GSP must be made via
       Longannet.
       Movements proceeding from Kincardine to Longannet must not be brought to a stand on the single line once clear of the
       siding connection.
       These arrangements are necessary because of the proximity of Kincardine LC (MSL) to the GSP.
