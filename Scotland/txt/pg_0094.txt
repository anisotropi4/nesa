      PERMISSIVE WORKING
      Platform lines - The detail shown in Table “A” is presented as follows :-
      Locations where permissive working is a regular feature - PP, for platform sharing, and PP(A) for attaching/detaching
      movements. These entries are qualified as necessary according to the conditions which apply at the location concerned.
      Locations / lines where permissive working is not normally used - PP(C) for contingency purposes. This would only be
      authorised during significant service disruption (see below). These entries specify the type of permissive working allowed ie
      platform sharing, attaching or detaching movements.
      Where the qualification “significant service disruption” is used, this must be understood to mean infrastructure failure, traction
      failure, resource failure (eg. traincrew), special events, working affected by engineering operations or security alert where
      permissive working would allow:
      increased line capacity, e.g. by attaching 2 trains together
      passengers to make alternative travel arrangements
      passengers to use the appropriate station’s facilities
      clearance of heavily delayed trains to be expedited.
      For all permissive movements other than booked working, Network Rail Route Control must be consulted and agree the
      arrangements concerned unless these have previously been published in a printed notice.
      If persons require to work on the outside of a train or vehicles at a stand on a running line or platform line where Permissive
      Working is authorised, the provisions of the Rule Book, Module T10 or Module TS1, General signalling regulations,
      regulation 13.1 are amplified to also require the line on which the train or vehicles is/are standing to be blocked to prevent a
      second movement proceeding towards the standing train or vehicles.
      This does not apply on platform lines where a platform lockout blocks both lines concerned.

      The following locations are permitted to have trains stabled in the platform during a blockage using Rule Book Module TS1,
      Regulation 13.2:
        • Glasgow Queen Street
        • Glasgow Central
        • Gourock
        • Wemyss Bay

      When a platform line is to be blocked under Rule Book Module TS1, Regulation 13.2 and a train is stabled on that line, the
      COSS must supply and ensure that the following protection is placed on the train before authorising the work to start:
      During daylight - a NOT TO BE MOVED board or a red flag.
      During darkness, fog, or falling snow - a red light (steady or flashing).
      The COSS must make sure the protection is displayed on the platform side of the train:
        • at the end from which the train is to be driven, or
        • at both ends of the train if it can be driven from either end.
