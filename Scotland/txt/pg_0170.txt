Rule Book Module TW7 - Wrong-direction movements
Section 1 - When a wrong-direction movement can be made
Class 380 EMUs

If a class 380 EMU overruns a station platform, in addition to carrying out the requirements of the Rule Book the driver
must:
    •    If one or more of the train doors remains on the platform, consider whether or not passengers can be allowed to
         board/alight safely using the external emergency egress device (EEED) at these door(s).
If a class 380 unit is required to set back to a station platform following an overrun, in addition to carrying out the
requirements of the Rule Book the driver must:
    •    Make sure the platform to which the train will return is long enough to accommodate the whole train.
    •    If the platform is not long enough to accommodate the whole train the train must continue to the next station. The
         driver should contact ScotRail Control to make suitable arrangements for any over carried passengers.
In the above circumstances the driver must come to a clear understanding with the signaller as to what has to be done.
