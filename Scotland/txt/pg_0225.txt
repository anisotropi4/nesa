Viewpark Sdgs - The person in charge of the movement must detrain when the train comes to a stand clear of signal
GMN185 and must proceed to the depot and check, in accordance with the Rule Book, Module S5, Section 3.1, that all
handpoints within the depot, facing to the incoming movement, are properly set for No.2 Road. The person in charge of
the movement may then, provided he has ensured that signal GMN185 has been cleared for the propelling movement to
the depot, instruct the driver to set back by either the use of handsignals or radio communication. The train must be
brought to a stand within the depot in No.2 Road, on the main line side of the crossover points.
The person in charge of the movement must then ascertain from the firm’s representative into which roads the wagons are
to be placed.
When shunting radios are in use, the driver must make an initial test transmission with the person in charge of the
movement when the train comes to a stand and before any propelling movement is made into the depot. This test
transmission must be preceded by the words “DRIVER TO PERSON IN CHARGE OF THE MOVEMENT” which must be
acknowledged. STRICT RADIO DISCIPLINE MUST BE MAINTAINED.
