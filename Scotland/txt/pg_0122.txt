       ULTRASONIC TEST TRAIN MARKERS
       Lineside markers consisting of a blue rectangular board with diagonal yellow stripe have been installed at selected
       locations throughout Scotland. These markers are provided for use of Engineer's staff and may be disregarded by
       traincrews.

       USER WORKED LEVEL CROSSINGS - WHISTLE
       BOARDS / SIGHTING BOARDS
       Whistle boards of a new design have been provided on the approaches to selected user worked level crossings to
       determine the effectiveness of train warning horns as a means of alerting road users to the approach of a train.
       The new boards are of rectangular design with a black St. Andrews cross surmounting a 'W', black lettering on
       a white retro-reflective background with a black border (see example below).




                                W
       On reaching the whistle board the driver must sound the two-tone horn continuously until approximately 50 yards from
       the crossing to which it applies (unless there is an obvious reason for maintaining the warning).
       The Rule Book, Module TW1, Section 45.2 is modified accordingly.
       Sighting marker boards are provided at various level crossings on the above lines for the purpose of assisting engineering
       staff and may, therefore, be disregarded by trainmen.
       Four markers are situated in the vicinity of each level crossing and are comprised of (facing crossing) a single sided yellow
       reflectorised rectangular board with a black border.
