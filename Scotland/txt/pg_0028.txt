       engineering work
       Possession Arrangements

       Level crossings
       Authority is granted for an AHB level crossing to remain on local control during the possession while the supervising signal
       box is closed. Sections 6.2 and 11.6 are modified accordingly.


       Staff safety
       To ensure staff safety when carrying out protection duties associated with the instructions contained in the Rule Book,
       Module T3 (Possession of the line for engineering work), authority is granted for the provision of a ‘T12’ (Protecting
       personnel carrying out activities on the line that do not affect the safety of the line), to facilitate these arrangements.


       Glasgow Central station area
       The following modified arrangements apply in respect of specific engineering work within the Glasgow Central station
       area, as agreed beforehand, and specially identified in Section B of the Weekly Operating Notice.
       The special form for recording details of modified possessions within Glasgow Central station area must be used (Section
       7 is modified accordingly).
       Protection arrangements associated with the possession must be carried out:
       • in full at the 'country' end of the possession
       • at the 'station' end, only ahead of those platforms that are occupied by trains.
       If this protection prevents movement to an intermediate line or siding within the limits of the possession, no further
       protection need be laid down.
       If it is necessary for a possession within the station area as defined on the special form to continue within a reduced area
       beyond the normal time for giving up such possessions (i.e. 07 00 hours), the details will be published as a separate item
       in the Weekly Operating Notice. In this case, the following instructions must be carried out for the shortened possession
       before the main station area possession is given up:
