Scotland Route Sectional Appendix Module SC1




ALL RED ZONE WORKING IS PROHIBITED
THROUGHOUT SCOTLAND ROUTE
All unassisted Red Zone working is prohibited by Scotland Route staff and their contractors. This includes working as an
Individual Working Alone or going down the hierarchy when green zone is or becomes unavailable.
You will still be allowed to “cross the line” or go round an obstacle as long as your primary SSOW is a green zone and you
have sighting distance and have a way of calculating this distance.
                                                                                     Scotland Route GI - Dated: 03/06/17


ANIMALS ON THE LINE
NOTICE TO TRAINCREW, SIGNALLERS AND CONTROLLERS

Where the rules and regulations (General Signalling Regulation 18.2 and Rule Book Module TW1 section 20) require that
trains be cautioned because of animals on the line, this procedure need not be applied providing that the animals are:

domestic, for example, dogs
deer
not more than six sheep

However, drivers are still required to make an initial report of the animals being ‘on the line’ and maintenance response
teams are mobilised to establish where the animals gained access to the line and where necessary effect repairs.

Once a report is received from a driver, then a general call will be put out by GSM-R to all trains in the area, advising them
of the approximate vicinity of the incursion and that they are not required to stop to report the incident.

Drivers are advised that if they believe the safety of trains is at risk then they are instructed to carry out the relevant
provisions of the Rule Book.

SWANS ON THE LINE

A train need only be cautioned for a swan on the line if the swan is reported to be within the “four foot” of the line
concerned



                                                                                     Scotland Route GI - Dated: 07/05/16



ANTI-VANDAL TRAINS
Anti-Vandal (Q) trains are permitted to run over any line in Scotland even though limitations on traffic types may be
published elsewhere for certain lines. These trains must be signalled by the Train Identification Code 5Z97 and where
train describers are not in use, must be signalled by the special bell signal 4 - 3 - 1. Anti-Vandal trains are authorised to
stop in section as required, and on other than Track Circuit Block lines must be accepted in accordance with Block
Regulation 3, regulation 3.7 (Absolute Block) or Block Regulation 3.8 (Electric Token Block) as appropriate.
                                                                                 Scotland Territory GI - Dated: 01/12/07
