REMOTE PLATFORM STARTING SIGNALS
Remote Platform Starting Signals (RPSS) identification plates are being provided at numerous stations within the
Scottish Region.
The RPSS identification plates are rectangular with a red border, having a warning triangle with an exclamation mark and
black lettering on a white background. They are being installed at the Car Stop marker boards, including HST “H” boards.
They indicate that the signal ahead is a RPSS and the method by which the driver should contact the signaller should the
signal remain at danger while they are stopped at the station.
The revised definition of a platform-starting signal is any signal capable of displaying a stop aspect, that is:
•   situated on or at the end of a platform, or
•   within a distance that the longest train that stops at the platform would still be partially on the platform when stopped
    at the signal,
•   and, in either case, where the train would have passed over the AWS magnet that applies to the signal, where fitted,
    prior to passing the platform end.
In practice the working definition used to identify platform-starting signals in the region has been any signal up to 220
yards off the end of the platform to which it applies.
Traincrew are reminded that where a platform-starting signal is provided the provisions of Rule Book Module SS1,
Sections 6.5(a) and 6.5(e) are applicable and should be applied. This will be obvious where the signal is on or at the end
of the platform, or within 10-yards of the platform end. However the following table contains a list of signals between 11
and 220 yards off the platform end where the above Rule Book provisions also apply.
When applying the provisions of the Rule Book Module SS1, Section 6.5(e), requiring the signaller’s permission to
proceed towards the signal when it is at danger, in respect of the signals in the table below, the following hierarchy of
means of communication should be used:
•   GSM-R, where it is fitted
•   The signal post telephone, where it is safe and practical to do so
•   Going to the signal box where it is located on or near the platform, where it is safe and practical to do so
•   A line side phone where provided on the platform
•   National Radio Network Phone
All messages concerning safety must be conducted in accordance with Rule Book Module G1, Section 11, and drivers
should ensure particularly that the signaller is fully aware of where they are speaking from, and the position of their train.
The use of a signal post telephone at other than the signal that applies to the train concerned should be avoided where
possible.
Remote Platform Starting Signals (RPSS) identification plates are being provided at the undernoted stations.
