If the red/green lights fail, trains must be cautioned in accordance with the signal box special instructions unless a
competent person is appointed at the level crossing to communicate with the signaller at Stanley Junction Pitlochry
Workstation. That person must obtain the signaller’s permission on each occasion before the crossing is used.


If the barrier controls fail and cannot be operated by the crossing users, an attendant qualified as competent by the local
operations manager must be appointed to operate the barriers by hand.


Upon arrival, the attendant must reach a clear understanding with the signaller at Stanley Junction Pitlochry Workstation
as to the method of working and then work to the signaller’s instructions.
