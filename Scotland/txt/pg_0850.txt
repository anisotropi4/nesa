Scotland Route Sectional Appendix Module SC13



Inverness Carriage Maintenance Depot

Prior to any movement from the Carriage Maintenance Depot which may proceed onto or foul the Harbour Road or
towards position light signal I716, the shunter must contact the signaller at Inverness signalling centre to ensure that no
movements have been signalled into the depot or Harbour Road, this includes signalled moves from position light signal
I736.
If the signaller advises that there are no movements signalled, the shunter may then authorise the driver to proceed onto
the Harbour Road or towards signal I716.
If the signaller advises that there is an incoming or Harbour Road movement signalled, the shunter must not authorise the
driver to move the train. The shunter must wait until the signalled movement has been made and again contact the
signaller as above.
