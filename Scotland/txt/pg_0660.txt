If it is necessary in an emergency to reverse a train which does not have direct access between the driving cabs at signal
SM61, the driver must arrange with the signaller at Stirling Middle for the passage of trains on the adjacent line to be
stopped before alighting, as shown in Rule Book Module TW1 section 46.
