       SC059 - GLASGOW CENTRAL TO STRANRAER
       Kilkerran SB & LC
       Failure of signalling equipment - If a failure between Kilkerran and Girvan requires the introduction of modified working
       arrangements, the driver will be authorised by the signaller to pass the Down section signal at danger and draw forward to
       the box. The driver must not proceed beyond the box until the written order has been received from the signaller (the
       instructions in Rule Book module P2, section 7, are modified accordingly).
