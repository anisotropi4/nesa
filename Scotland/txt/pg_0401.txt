       Rail Vehicle Movements Into/ Out of Maintenance Buildings
       Where reference is made in the following instructions to a movement into/ out of a Maintenance Building, this must also be
       understood to include a rail vehicle movement towards the underframe wash pit.
         9.When required to move vehicles into a Maintenance Building on a depot siding, the driver must stop at the signal
           situated on the approach to the Maintenance Building doors on the siding concerned.
         10. The shunter must press the plunger mounted on the signal. The plunger must not be operated until the train is at
           a stand at the signal. If the Designated Person has removed all the protection inside the Maintenance Building,
           opened the Maintenance Building doors and lowered the derailer, the signal will show a proceed aspect. The
           driver may then proceed with the movement as far as the line is clear, keeping a good lookout at all times for
           persons or obstructions.
         11. If after the plunger has been pressed the Maintenance Building doors remain closed and the signal continues to
           display a stop aspect, the shunter must request the Designated Person to remove the protection. When this has
           been done, the shunter must again press the plunger on the signal to change it to a proceed aspect. The
           movement may then proceed as far as the line is clear.
         12. A movement out of a Maintenance Building must not be started unless the exit signal concerned at the
           Maintenance Building door is showing a proceed aspect or the conditions detailed in Clause 7 have been met. A
           movement must only proceed as far as the line is clear. These instructions also apply when the whole of the train
           is not within the Maintenance Building in which case the shunter is responsible for advising the driver when the
           Maintenance Building exit signal concerned is showing a proceed aspect.
