Glasgow Central – Where a platform lockout is to be used under the alternative arrangements detailed in the General
Instructions under the heading “Protection of Staff on or about the line by Lockout”, for the type of work specified, the
procedure detailed below is additional to the requirements of the Rule Book, Module T10.
The General Instructions headed “CLEANING TRACK AREAS IN STATIONS”, “PASSENGER STATIONS –
WHITELINING OF PLATFORM EDGES” and “WATERING OF VEHICLES AT STATIONS” do not apply.
General
The agreement of the signaller in the West of Scotland SC is necessary before platform lines (or other lines within the
station area) are blocked to traffic.
The operation of the lockout key prevents signal routes to and from the affected platform(s) being cleared by the signaller.
The lockout key is locked in the appropriate lockfast cabinet and the lockout key can only be released with the co-
operation of the signaller.
A lockout key may also provide protection for the adjoining (platform) line(s). The lines affected by operation of a lockout
key are shown within the cabinet containing the lockout key.
When work is to take place on a train, or a train is standing in a platform line(s) to be protected by the lockout, the person
requiring the blockage must arrange to provide protection on the train / vehicles as shown in Section 6 of the Rule Book,
Module T10, Duties of a designated person (DP) and people working on rail vehicles.
Method of Protection
Imposing the blockage
When it is necessary to block a platform line to protect staff, the following procedure must be carried out:
(a)      Before work starts, the permission of the signaller must be obtained by telephone from the appropriate lockout
cabinet by the person requiring the blockage. If the signaller is satisfied that the working of the station will not be unduly
disrupted, he will give the person requiring the blockage a task number.
(b)       The person requiring the blockage must:
      •   unlock the appropriate lockfast cabinet
      •   telephone the signaller giving his name, employing organisation and the task number he has been given
      •   ask for the appropriate platform blockage
