Scotland Route Sectional Appendix Module SC6

     Method of Protection

When it is necessary to block a platform line to protect staff, the following procedure must be observed
a)    Before work commences, the permission of the ScotRail Station Duty Manager must be obtained by the person
      requiring the blockage. The ScotRail Station Duty Manager must be satisfied that the working of the station will not
      be unduly disrupted during the blockage and speak with the signaller at Cowlairs Workstation 1 (Edinburgh IECC) to
      agree what arrangements will be necessary during this period to maintain the train service.
When a clear understanding has been reached between the ScotRail Station Duty Manager and the signaller, the ScotRail
Station Duty Manager must record the details of the person requiring the blockage, the line(s) affected, the nature of the
work and time required in the book provided for this purpose. When this has been done, the ScotRail Station Duty
Manager may give the person requiring the blockage permission to telephone the signaller from the appropriate lockout
cabinet.
b)    The person requiring the blockage must unlock the appropriate lockfast cabinet, telephone the signaller giving his
      name and employing organisation, request the appropriate platform blockage, indicate for how long this will be
      required and obtain a task number from the signaller. The signaller will record this detail.
c)    When the signaller is able to grant the blockage, the ‘Free’ indication in the cabinet will illuminate and the person
      requiring protection must press the button and, simultaneously, turn the lockout key to release it from the cabinet.
      Provided the “Free” indication has extinguished, the person requiring protection must confirm to the signaller that the
      lockout key is in his possession, ask the signaller to read him the entry he has made and, if satisfied this is correct,
      repeat his name and employing organisation and task number allocated. The cabinet must then be relocked.
d)    If the signaller cannot agree to giving the release when, or soon after, requested, he (the signaller) must liaise with the
      ScotRail Station Duty Manager as to when the work can be allowed to commence.
     During the work

The lockout key must be retained in the personal possession of the person who requested the blockage until returned to
the cabinet.
     When work is completed

a)    When the work has been completed and everyone is clear of the line, the person who requested protection must
      advise the signaller accordingly, repeating his name, employing organisation and task number. When instructed by
      the signaller, the person who requested protection must insert the lockout key then relock the cabinet. Confirmation
      must be given to the ScotRail Station Duty Manager that the lockout key has been replaced in the cabinet, the
      signaller advised and the cabinet locked. The ScotRail Station Duty Manager will endorse the relevant entry in the
      book accordingly.
b)    The person requesting lockout protection in the first instance must, except in exceptional circumstances, be the same
      individual who completes the work and gives up the protection. In exceptional circumstances, the person requesting
      lockout protection may hand over to a relief provided he advises the signaller, and the ScotRail Station Duty Manager,
      the name and employing organisation of his relief, and quotes the task number to the signaller.
