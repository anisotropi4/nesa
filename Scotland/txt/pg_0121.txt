Scotland Route Sectional Appendix Module SC1




WORKING OF TRAINS WHICH ARE NOT FULLY FITTED
Trains must not be allowed to enter service unless working under fully fitted conditions.
Authority is, however, granted for the movement of dead multiple unit vehicles between Shields ETD and Glasgow Works
(Springburn), and vice versa, in a non-fully fitted formation as shown in the Rule Book, Module TW1, Section 16. The
reference to the automatic brake to be fully operative throughout in clause 16.1 is exempt.
If an accident occurs to a train causing the brakes to be non-operational, the vehicles concerned may be moved to clear
the running line if:
•   each movement must be specially authorised by the appropriate Operations Manager, or immediate Deputy
•   any one movement must not exceed three unbraked vehicles
•   speed must not exceed 5 mph
•   any additional instructions specified by the Operations Manager, or immediate Deputy, must be carried
    out.
When a failed multiple unit train needs to be assisted and the brakes between the failed and assisting train cannot be
coupled, the above arrangements do not apply but the appropriate Operating Company instructions must be carried out.
                                                                              Scotland Territory GI - Dated: 07/12/13


YARD WORKING
Drivers and other competent persons must not allow their trains to run at a greater speed than 5 mph except where
authorised in Table A and must keep a look out and be prepared to stop short of any obstruction that may be in front or in
obedience to signals.
