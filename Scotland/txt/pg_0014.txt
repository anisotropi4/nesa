following modifications apply:
•   the Single Line Working ticket must not be cancelled by the driver before it is returned to the pilotman
•   only one Single Line Working ticket need be issued by the pilotman at the commencement of duty and this must be
    collected from, and issued to, each driver. Where there is a change of pilotman, the Single Line Working ticket must
    be cancelled by the pilotman going off duty. The new pilotman must issue a new Single Line Working ticket which
    must be collected from, and issued to, each driver. After the last train of the day has been dealt with, the pilotman
    must cancel the Single Line Working ticket.
