* Lockout temporarily out of use.
Edinburgh Waverley and Haymarket platform lockouts - alternative procedure - Where a platform lockout is to be
used under the alternative arrangements detailed in the General Instructions under the heading “Protection of Staff on
or about the line by Lockout”, for the type of work specified, the procedure detailed below is additional to the
requirements of the Rule Book, Module T10.
The General Instructions headed “CLEANING TRACK AREAS IN STATIONS” do not apply.
General
The term ‘platform lockout’ within these instructions also covers other lines / sidings within the station area, Calton Tunnel
(excl) to Mound Tunnel (excl), which are subject to these procedures. It does not include tunnel lockouts which are
detailed separately.
Throughout these instructions, the term ‘signalling centre manager’ means the regulator (when on duty), or shift manager,
as appropriate.
The agreement of the signalling centre manager is necessary before platform lines (or other lines within the station area)
are blocked to traffic.
The operation of the lockout key prevents signal routes to and from the affected platform(s) being cleared by the signaller.
The lockout key is locked in the appropriate lockfast cabinet and the lockout key can only be released with the co-
operation of the signaller.
A lockout key may also provide protection for the adjoining (platform) line(s). The lines affected by operation of a lockout
key are shown within the cabinet containing the lockout key.
When work is to take place on a train, or a train is standing in a platform line(s) to be protected by the lockout, the person
requiring the blockage must arrange to provide protection on the train / vehicles as shown in Rule Book, Module T10.
