       GROUND FRAMES RELEASED FROM SIGNAL BOXES
       Where telephone communication between a ground frame and a signal box is provided, the competent person must speak
       with the signaller, by telephone, before leaving and, if the apparatus fails, must obey any instructions given to him by the
       signaller. At intermediate sidings at which trains may be shunted for other trains to pass (shown in Table A) where the
       ground frame is electrically controlled from a signal box, the following instructions must be carried out:
       • In order that the electrical controls may become operative, the whole train when on the running line must, where the
         points are trailing, be drawn clear of the points and brought to a stand with the rear vehicle positioned immediately in
         advance of the siding connection. Where the points are facing, the train must be brought to a stand on the approach
         side of the points or, where provided, at the signal applying from the running line to the siding. The competent person
         must then communicate with the signaller and ask permission to operate the ground frame. The signaller must tell the
         competent person when the release is given.
       • When the movement has been made and the complete train has been shunted into the siding(s) clear of the running
         line(s) or has been brought to a stand on the running line clear of the points ready to depart and the ground frame
         levers have been placed in the normal position, the competent person must tell the signaller who must restore the
         ground frame and tell the competent person when this has been done. Until this advice is received, the competent
         person must not rejoin the train or allow it to proceed.
