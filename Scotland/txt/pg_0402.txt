         13. No vehicle or part of a vehicle must be allowed to pass a signal showing a stop aspect except during failure and
           then only under direct supervision of the Designated Person.
         14. The passing of a red signal will be treated in the same way as a signal passed at danger.
         15. However, if the signals into or out of a Maintenance Building fail when a movement is required, then the vehicle
           must stop at the signal and must only proceed as far as the line is clear after the Designated Person has
           personally advised the driver and shunter that protection has been removed and the stop aspect signal may be
           passed.
