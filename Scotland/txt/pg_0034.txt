AUTOMATIC WARNING SYSTEM
Additional track equipment
At the undernoted locations, additional AWS track equipment is provided as shown. An AWS warning indication will be
received only when the signal is at RED. No AWS indication will be received when a proceed aspect (including position
light, where applicable) is exhibited nor, on a line signalled for two-way working, where a movement passes over the
equipment concerned in the opposite direction. Where an AWS warning indication is received on passing over the track
equipment provided immediately in advance of the signal, the driver must immediately stop the train and contact the
signaller as quickly as possible.
In the event of a failure of any of the additional AWS track equipment detailed below, the driver must ensure that the
precise location of the equipment is clearly identified on Form RT 3185.
