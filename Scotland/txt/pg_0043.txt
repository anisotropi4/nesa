       CLASS 158 DMU’S - SEVERE WEATHER CONDITIONS
       Due to experience of Class 158 DMU's braking characteristics, during freezing or snow conditions the following
       instructions MUST be rigidly adhered to.
       1.  Running Brake Test
       The brake must be tested every 2 minutes in the following circumstances:-
         a)during freezing conditions
         b)when snow is falling
         c)when fallen snow is being disturbed by winds or by passing trains.
       When this running brake test is made, the driver must make a Step 3 FULL SERVICE BRAKE application with a 10 MPH
       reduction in speed.
       2.  Speed Restriction
       ADDITIONALLY, when severe weather conditions as described above are experienced, the driver must reduce speed to a
       maximum of 75 MPH or any lower speed as required by the maximum permitted speed on any portion of the line. Speed
       must be restricted to 10 MPH below the permitted line speed but need not be restricted to less than 50 MPH.
       If this speed restriction is necessary the driver must report the circumstances to Network Rail Route Control by the most
       expeditious means.
