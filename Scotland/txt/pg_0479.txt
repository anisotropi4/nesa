EASTFIELD DEPOT
All trains arriving at Depot
The Signaller at Cowlairs signal box will activate a slot request to the Yard Co-ordinator for a train to enter the Depot.
Such a release must not be given unless the Yard Co-ordinator is satisfied that it is safe to do so and no conflicting move
has been authorised.
The Yard Co-ordinator will release a slot for either CET/Fuel Road number 1, CET Fuel road number 2 or for the Depot
Sidings.
Drivers routed to CET/Fuel roads numbers 1or 2, must proceed to the CET/Fuel road stopping at the “STOP and check
line ahead is clear before proceeding” board, sound the low tone on the horn and drive directly to the far end of the shed
or 2 metres from any train already occupying the line.
Drivers routed to the Depot sidings must stop at the “STOP and telephone for instructions board” and contact the Yard Co-
ordinator who will advise which siding the train must then proceed to.
Where an arriving train cannot enter the Depot the Signaller will, where practicable, route the train in to Down sidings
number 1 or number 2. Drivers must proceed to the buffer end.
Departing Trains
Drivers of all trains leaving the Depot must report to the Yard Co-ordinator for instructions.
Departure via Depot Sidings
Drivers must then contact the Yard Co-ordinator from the telephone at the end of the sidings and advise that they are now
ready to depart.
The Yard Co-ordinator will advise the Signaller at Cowlairs.
Drivers will then be advised by the Yard Co-ordinator to proceed to signal CC529.
Departure via CET/Fuel roads numbers 1 or 2
The Yard Co-ordinator will advise the Signaller when a train is to depart via either CET/Fuel road number 1 or 2.

road number 2) when instructed by the Yard Co-ordinator.
