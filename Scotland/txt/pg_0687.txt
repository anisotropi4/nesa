Method of Protection
Imposing the blockage
When it is necessary to block a platform line to protect staff, the following procedure must be carried out:
(a)      Before work starts, the permission of the signalling centre manager must be obtained by the person requiring the
         blockage. If the signalling centre manager is satisfied that the working of the station will not be unduly disrupted
         during the blockage he will give the person requiring the blockage permission to telephone the signaller from the
         appropriate lockout cabinet and also give that person a task number to quote to the signaller.
(b)      The person requiring the blockage must:
             unlock the appropriate lockfast cabinet
             telephone the signaller giving his name, employing organisation and the task number he has been given
             ask for the appropriate platform blockage
             tell the signaller for how long this will be required
         The signaller will record this detail.
(c)      When the signaller is able to grant the blockage, a green indication in the cabinet will illuminate and the person
         requiring protection must press the button and, simultaneously, turn the lockout key to release it from the cabinet.
         If the green indication has extinguished, the person requiring protection must:
            confirm to the signaller that the lockout key is in his possession
            ask the signaller to read him the entry he has made and, if satisfied this is correct, repeat his name and
             employing organisation and task number allocated.
            relock the cabinet.
(d)      If the signaller cannot agree to giving the release when, or soon after, requested, he will liaise with the signalling
         centre manager as to when the work can be allowed to commence.


Method of Protection
During the work
The lockout key must be retained in the personal possession of the person who requested the blockage until returned to
the cabinet.
