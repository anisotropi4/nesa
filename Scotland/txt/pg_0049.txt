EXAMINATION AND OILING OF SCREW COUPLINGS ON

At the stations where C&W staff are employed, the duty of oiling screw couplings devolves upon that department. At all
other stations the responsibility rests with the goods handling staff, and each person in charge concerned must depute
one of his staff to examine these couplings and see they are oiled and put in fit condition before the vehicles are worked
away.
