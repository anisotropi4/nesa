       ROUTE PROVING TRAINS THROUGHOUT SCOTLAND
       ROUTE.
       As a result of severe weather events occurring on infrastructure where trains have not been running, a route proving run is
       conducted to assess the integrity of the infrastructure before the restoration of normal train services.
       Network Rail Control will contact the controlling signalbox and brief the signaller on the details of the planned proving
       services.
       The signaller will advise each driver in charge of a route proving train prior to the commencement of the journey that they
       are being used to prove the route and the sections of line(s) that need to be proved.
       Route proving train drivers will proceed over the affected portion of the line at caution being prepared to stop short of
       obstructions.
       *Speed based upon the braking capability of the traction being driven and distance ahead which can be seen clear.
