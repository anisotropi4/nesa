The above lockouts are of the “key enabled” type. Keys are issued personally to the appropriate staff that are required to
operate these lockouts. To activate any of these lockouts, the COSS must reach a clear understanding with the signaller
at West of Scotland Signalling Centre.
The lockout protection may be obtained, and given up, at any of the cabinet locations listed for the lockout concerned.
It is important to ensure that, if the lockout protection is given up at a different location from which is was obtained; the
correct lockout unit must be used. The COSS must ensure the key is removed when the protection is given up.
