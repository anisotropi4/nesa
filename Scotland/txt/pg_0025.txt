•      normal Module T3 procedures must be followed and the PICOP must record all details on the “Record of Possession
       Arrangements” form (RT3198/1)
•      the PICOP must make sure that the necessary protection is provided for the shortened possession and give the
       signaller an assurance when this has been done
•      the main station area possession may then be given up and the special form for recording details of modified
       possessions within Glasgow Central station area completed.
This arrangement may also be used when an overrun is likely to occur within the main station area possession, or any
emergency or other abnormal circumstance arises associated with this possession, if a clear understanding is reached
between all concerned. The special form for recording details of modified possessions must be suitably endorsed.
If a possession previously agreed as coming within the scope of the modified arrangements is amended by circular, such
modified arrangements cease to be applicable and normal Module T3 procedures must be observed.
West of Scotland SC has a list of PICOPs competent to carry out the above modified procedure.
