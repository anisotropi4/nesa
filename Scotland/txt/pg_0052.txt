       COUPLING / MULTIPLE RUNNING OF LOCOMOTIVES
       Not more than two locomotives coupled together (whether running light or being hauled “dead”) are permitted on any
       running line within Scotland Route, except where authorised by the Network Rail Structures Engineer. The approval of
       Network Rail Route Control must be obtained before multiple running of locomotives is permitted. Multiple running means
       a movement of 3 or more locomotives (of unlimited number and of any type or types) coupled together.
       A standing authority has been granted for multiple locomotive movements over certain routes / structures (but not
       excessive RA movements). These are listed in the following table, although it must be noted that this may be amended
       from time to time to take account of other bridges that may be affected by flood damage, vehicle strike etc. For this
       reason, all multiple running requests must be made to Network Rail Route Control, in the first instance.
       Where a route is not listed in the accompanying table, or relaxation on standing authority is requested, or where the
       multiple running involves excessive RA movements, the authority of the Network Rail Structures Engineer must always be
       obtained via Network Rail Route Control.
