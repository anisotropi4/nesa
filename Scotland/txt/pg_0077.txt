Scotland Route Sectional Appendix Module SC1




MULTIPLE UNIT TRAINS EQUIPPED WITH AUTOMATIC
COUPLERS
To assist staff in identifying automatic couplers which could be damaged by coupling the train to another train, T&RS staff
will fix a yellow and black "Non Multi-" sign, black and white example shown below, to the offside windscreen of the cab
concerned so that the sign will be directly opposite the driver of another train.
During normal working, no attempt should be made to couple an automatic coupler so identified.
If a train equipped with automatic couplers fails and requires assistance, the trainman of the failed train must, when
requesting assistance, specifically advise the signaller whether or not a "Non Multi-" sign is displayed in either of the end
cabs of the train.
Similarly, the driver of the assisting train, before proceeding towards the failed train, must specifically advise the signaller
whether or not a "Non Multi-" sign is displayed in the cab at the end which would be coupled to the failed train.
If the circumstances arise where assistance can only be provided in such a manner that one or other of the cabs to be
coupled has a "Non Multi-" sign displayed, technical advice must be obtained. Under no circumstance should any attempt
be made to couple the trains until this advice is received. Technical authority may be granted to couple the trains using
the automatic couplers but subject to conditions which will be specified at the time. If such authority is not granted, it will
be necessary to use an emergency coupling.
