COUPLING AND UNCOUPLING OF LOADED MULTIPLE
UNITS EQUIPPED WITH AUTOMATIC COUPLERS
Where it is necessary to couple or uncouple two multiple units, either of which is loaded, the undermentioned working
must be adopted. Prior to coupling, after the first train has come to a stand at the platform, the second train may be
admitted in accordance with Permissive Working, or special instructions, as the case may be.
A handsignaller (who may be the guard of the first train) must be posted six feet to the rear of the first train and the driver
of the second train must bring his train to a stand opposite to the handsignaller.
The handsignaller may give permission for the second train to move forward to couple on to the rear of the first train as
soon as he is satisfied it is safe to do so.
During coupling or uncoupling operations at station platforms, all passenger doors must be kept closed. If this is not
possible, station staff must prevent passengers joining or alighting through the open doors until the movement has been
completed.
                                                                                Scotland Territory GI - Dated: 02/12/06


CT7 PLATES FOR GSM-R
On routes where signalling system train describer data is not provided, the GSM-R network will route any calls or
operational text messages sent from a cab radio to a ‘Nominated Signaller’ for each radio cell. As signaller boundaries can
sit within a cell, this person may not be the Signaller who controls the area for that train. At certain signals on these routes,
GSM-R signal box phone number plates have been provided to show the Driver that, to contact the Signaller who controls
the area, they should dial the GSM-R fixed terminal phone number shown on the sign, instead of using the <SG>
message or Call Signaller button. This process is described in the Driver Users Procedures, (issued by RSSB), Sect 4.3.
Locations with these signs in Scotland Route, soon to be input to the Sectional Appendix, are as follows: -
