Scotland Route Sectional Appendix Module SC1




CLASS 220 UNITS - EMERGENCY SANDING EQUIPMENT
Class 220 units are fitted with emergency sanding equipment which the driver will operate when it is necessary to stop the
train in conditions of very low adhesion. Each driving cab carries one application of sand, and once the equipment has
been operated from that cab, the facility will not again be available until the containers have been replaced.
Duties of drivers

When the emergency sanding equipment has been used the train must be brought to a stand and the driver must inform
the signaller immediately and report the following :-
•   that the sanding equipment has been operated (either for a genuine emergency or in error due to a fault).
•   the location where the equipment was discharged and the current location of the train.
•   why the equipment was operated i.e. whether for a genuine emergency, system fault or operated in error.
•   location(s) of any poor adhesion which caused the sander to be needed.
•   the unit and vehicle number on which the equipment was operated.
Duties of signallers

On receipt of a report from a driver that the emergency sanding equipment has been operated, the signaller must :-
•   deal with the first train over the portion of line from where the sander was operated to where the train stopped as if
    following a Sandite train by applying the instructions shown in the Rule Book, Module TS1, Section 12
•   where poor adhesion problems have been reported, the instructions shown in the Rule Book, Module TW1, Section
