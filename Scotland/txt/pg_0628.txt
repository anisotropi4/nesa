DALMALLY TEP To TAYNUILT TEP

Pass of Brander - Automatic stone signals - Between the 51Â¾ and 56 mile posts in the Pass of Brander, 16 automatic
stone signals are erected on the South or loch side, and one near the 54 mile post on the North or hill side of the line, at
irregular distances from each other, and at points where the best view can be obtained of them from either direction. All
these signal posts carry an Up and a Down arm, with the exception of the one at the East end which carries a Down arm
only, and the one at the West end which carries an Up arm only. The signals are connected by a number of wires forming
a screen which runs along the top of the railway slope on the hill side of the line, and so long as the screen wires remain
intact, the signals remain clear; but in the event of a stone falling from the mountain and one or more wires being broken;
Up and Down signals go to danger. Every alternate wire passes the first signal post and is connected with the second
signal post, and when a driver sights a signal at danger he must reduce speed and proceed cautiously in accordance with
the Rule Book, Module S5, until a second clear signal is reached - as there may be one clear signal between two danger
ones - or until the last special signal for the falling stones is passed. He must also inform the signaller at Banavie
signalling centre by radio that a stone signal is at danger.
                                                                                                          Dated: 02/12/06
