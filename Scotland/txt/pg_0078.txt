       LIMITED COVERAGE ON FREIGHT ONLY BRANCH LINES
       The freight-only branch lines listed in the table below are sections of permanent poor GSM-R coverage.
       These areas of poor coverage are in tunnels and deep cuttings resulting in GSM-R calls may be unreliable, as
       with previous NRN coverage. If a train is in a poor coverage area at the time the emergency call is initiated,
       the train radio will receive the emergency call as soon as there is sufficient GSM-R coverage

       GSM-R FAULTS AND FAILURES RESPONSE

       VERSION 1.1

       PURPOSE

       To provide guidance on the response to onboard GSM-R system faults and local/area infrastructure faults.
       Appendix 1 covers the response to system faults from a single fixed terminal through to failures of the
       infrastructure resulting in loss of coverage in a geographical area.
