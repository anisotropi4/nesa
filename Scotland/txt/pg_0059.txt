FREIGHTLINER VEHICLES - PLATFORMS IN EXCESS OF
3 FEET 3 INCHES ABOVE RAIL LEVEL
Due to modifications in construction, the floor height of certain Freightliner vehicles has been increased from 3 feet 3
inches to 3 feet 5 inches above rail level. When loaded with standard containers (8 feet 0 inches by 8 feet 0 inches profile)
these vehicles are outwith the standard BR load gauge and until further notice their movement is subject to the undernoted
speed restrictions:-

ROUTE                              LOCATION                                 RESTRICTION
8 feet 0 inches by 8 feet 0 inches Profile Containers
Glasgow to Edinburgh via           Down line      Winchburgh Tunnel         30 mph
Carmyle, Sighthill, Cowlairs       Up Line        Winchburgh Tunnel          30 mph
and Falkirk HIgh or via
Carmyle, Sighthill and Falkirk
Grahamston


Movements of these vehicles when so loaded over the routes concerned will be under authority of BR29973 - Advice to
Train Crew of Exceptional Loads - appropriately endorsed.
                                                                             Scotland Territory GI - Dated: 02/12/06


FREIGHTLINER WAGONS
Freightliner Wagons (First 100 Wagons)

         Outer Wagons B601003 to B601020 inclusive.
         Inner Wagons B602003 to B602084 inclusive.
These wagons, which do not have axle mounted discs can negotiate small curves, down to 2½ chs., but such curves must
be negotiated very slowly and with very great care, particularly with fully laden wagons.
Freightliner/ISO Wagons (Second Batch)

         Outer Wagons B601021 upwards
         Inner Wagons B602085 upwards
The minimum radius of curve which these wagons can safely negotiate is 3½ chs. and this must be at a maximum of 2
mph. The worst condition so far as throw-overs are concerned is two 6½ chain curves with a 10 foot straight between
them and again this must be negotiated at very low speed, as under these conditions the bar couplers are at the extreme
ends of the slots in the headstocks.
                                                                             Scotland Territory GI - Dated: 02/12/06
