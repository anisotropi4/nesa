       Diesel traction must specifically NOT draw power when passing through any of the above stations, from either
       direction.
       Signallers must ensure that, where possible and practicable, these trains are regulated accordingly back at
       either Partick or Rutherglen such that they can coast through on clear signals.
       The Train Running Controller must also remind train crews of this instruction prior to passing through any of
       the above stations.
       The reason for this instruction is to avoid the unnecessary activation of the smoke alarm at the above stations.
