If two trains are to be accommodated at the same platform, the total number of vehicles must be determined by referring
to the above table and using the number given for the second train arriving.
Notes:-
    •   Selective Door Opening (SDO) will only release doors on front 11 coaches.
    •   If two trains are to be accommodated in platforms 4, 5, or 6, and the second train arriving is formed of a Class
        465 / 466 then the total number of vehicles must NOT exceed 10.

Passing Signals at Danger - Forward Route Setting
Due to conductor rail gapping issues, the signals listed below are provided with ‘Forward Route Setting’ controls. These
signals require the route to be set before the signal in rear will clear to a proceed aspect. This is to avoid trains stopping
on the approach to the signal and becoming gapped.
When it is necessary to pass a signal with ‘Forward Route Setting’ controls at danger, the Signaller will give the driver
authority to pass the affected signal at danger from the signal in rear to avoid a train stopping at the affected signal and
becoming gapped. Where possible, the Signaller will set the route from the affected signal to enable the signal in rear to
clear to a proceed aspect after the Driver has been given the necessary instructions.
If it is not possible to set a route from a signal with ‘Forward Route Setting’ controls and it is necessary to pass both the
affected signal and signal in rear at danger, the Signaller will authorise the driver to pass both signals at danger from the
first signal. It will not be necessary for Temporary Block Working to be introduced in this instance.
