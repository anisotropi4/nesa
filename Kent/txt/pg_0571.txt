2       Train protection system (KVB)
2.1     The KVB system does not relieve you of your responsibility for observing colour light signals and speed
        restrictions.
2.2     Where the system is located and what it does
        2.2.1   KVB is a train protection system using on-board equipment and balises on the track. KVB will:
        •       constantly monitor and control the maximum speed of trains
        •       monitor the speed of trains approaching colour light signals displaying a “DANGER” aspect
        •       monitor the passing of colour light signals displaying a “DANGER” aspect
        •       monitor the speed of trains approaching a reduction in permissible speed
        2.2.2   KVB is provided in the colour light signal controlled area of the International Chords and through
                Platforms 3 and 4 at Ashford International Station.
3.1     KVB cab equipment
        3.1.1   The KVB cab equipment consists of a console which contains:
                •          an auxiliary indicator, and
                •          a principle indicator, and
                •          a number of function buttons
        3.1.2   The indications displayed in the indicators are described in traction specific instructions.
3.2     KVB operation
        3.2.1   The KVB system will become active after passing over a balise on the approach to the Ashford colour
                light signal controlled area.
        3.2.2   From that point the KVB system will monitor the speed of the train and signal aspect until the train
                leaves the KVB controlled area.
        3.2.3   If the KVB system detects that the train is travelling at a speed of 5 km/h but less than 10 km/h than the
                permitted speed, audible and visual warnings will be given.
        3.2.4   You must immediately reduce the speed of the train to the permitted speed or less. Provided you reduce
                the speed of your train sufficiently:-
                •          the audible warning will stop, and
                •          the visual indication will be extinguished.
        3.2.5   If the KVB system detects that the train is travelling at a speed of 10 km/h or more than the permitted
                speed the system will:-
                •         make an emergency brake application,
                •         give additional visual indications, and
                •         open the Traction Circuit Breaker (cut traction power).
        3.2.6   When an automatic brake application is initiated as a result of the operation of the KVB system, you
                must:-
                •        confirm the KVB brake application, and
                •        make sure the train is stopped, and
                •        immediately tell the signaller what has happened, and
                •        carry out the signaller’s instructions, and
                •        not make any further movement with your train until you are told to do so
        3.2.7   If, when approaching a colour light stop signal displaying a DANGER aspect you see the signal change
                to display a “Proceed” aspect, you must not resume normal speed until you have passed the signal
                concerned.
3.3     Temporary isolation of KVB on-board equipment
        3.3.1   After isolating the KVB system, you must record that you have done so in accordance with your
                company’s procedures.
        3.3.2   You must return the KVB isolating switch to the "normal" position when :-
                •        assistance to the failed train is no longer needed and your train has been uncoupled, or
                •        leaving a Worksite.
