Overlay Miniature Stop Light (OMSL) level crossing
Certain level crossings are provided with overlay miniature stop light equipment.Like conventional Miniature Stop Light
(MSL) crossings, these provide indications to the users of the crossings on whether it is safe to cross (green) or not safe
to cross (red). The system is designed to overlay existing infrastructure without interacting with it (Note: I-OMSL type
crossing will interact), however permissible speeds in the wrong direction on the approach should be identified on multiple
track lines by wrong direction speed boards. The system is usually activated by wheel sensors that operate in a similar
way to axle counters – when they detect a train they set the lights to red, when the train hits the strike out sensor the lights
go to green.
Where a system failure is detected or operational scenario (e.g. train failure, engineering works) may incur the red
indication for excessive periods, user indications are suppressed and the lights go into ‘dark mode’. On encountering this
mode the user is directed on safe operation by the signage provided, however they can be reactivated by another train
passing or through a manual reset.
All staff should note that, like axle counters, using metal tools or simply passing within a metre wearing safety boots can
cause activation of these sensors, and should be avoided.
