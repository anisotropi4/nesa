    WORK COMMENCES

This flowchart must be read in conjunction with the Rule Book Module TS1.13, Rule Book Handbooks 1, 6, 7, & 8, and
NR/L3/ELP/3091 Instruction
A Temporary Isolation AND a Safeguard Protection MUST both be in place before the COSS allows any work to take
place.
TS1.13 protection can be used if appropriate to protect the work.
Temporary Isolations can only be taken on Network Rail Managed Infrastructure.
Signal Protection provided for a Temporary Isolation must never be relied upon to provide staff with a Safe
System of Work when walking or working on or near the line.

    COMPLETION OF WORK
    ↓

    COSS confirms to the PICTI that all work is complete and the
    Temporary Isolation is no longer required, so may be
    recharged.

    ↓

    PICTI confirms to ECO that all work is complete and all
    persons, tools, equipment, and short circuiting bars are clear of
    the line(s). PICTI requests recharge.
