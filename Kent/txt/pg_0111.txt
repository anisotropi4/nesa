D.C. Electric Traction current loading
The number of electric locomotives or electric multiple units working under D.C. electric power in any train or movement
must be limited to avoid excessive traction current being drawn.
A conductor rail current index number is allocated to locomotives and electric multiple units as set out below. Unless
specially authorised, the combined index numbers of all locomotives and electric multiple units working under DC electric
power in train or movement (whether or not in multiple) must not exceed 16 (or any lower figure for the route concerned as
detailed in the local instructions).
                                                                                      Index No.

3 car electric multiple units                                                              4
2 car departmental units (except units nos. 931001, 931002 and 932053)                     4
2 car electric multiple units                                                              4
2 car departmental units nos. 931001, 931002 and 932053                                    2
Class 489 Gatwick Express Luggage Vans                                                     2
Single car departmental units (former Class 419 Motor Luggage Vans)                        2


Notes:
The conductor rail index of trains formed of Class 319 units must not exceed 12. Trains must not exceed 3 4 car electric
multiple units unless additional electrical multiple units have the traction equipment isolated.
Class 373 units and class 92 locomotives are only authorised to work under DC electric power on those routes listed in the
route clearance tables of Modules SE2 and SE3 of the Kent, Sussex & Wessex Routes Sectional Appendix. They must
not be worked under power in any movement when coupled to any other electric traction unit that is working under DC
electric power.
