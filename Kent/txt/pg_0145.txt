Management of Trains with Gauge or Routing
Restrictions in Southern Region
Principles
This procedure covers how trains operating with routing or gauge restrictions will be advised to Network Rail Southern
Region staff and Network Rail staff planning train services on Southern Region. It mandates principles for use of
appropriate head codes to distinguish trains which need special attention.

Background
Gauge is not absolute and new vehicles must be specifically cleared for each route they are required to run over.
Restrictions on train services can relate either to the load they carry or to the vehicles themselves and there are a variety
of means of documenting them:
•   •    Statement of Compatibility (SoC, the source document for rolling stock, ref GE/RT8270)
•   •    Sectional Appendix Route Clearance Tables (based on SoC for traffic running regularly in Route)
•   •    RT3973 (Loads information: CON, HAW, EXL and NUC)
•   •    Route Loads Book
There are essentially 2 types of restriction from a signaller’s perspective:
•   •   Routing and speed restrictions which the signaller is to be aware of but for which they are not the primary
    controller of risk
•   •   Restrictions (such as a requirement to block the other line for the passage of a train) which only the signaller can
    implement
Notification to Operations Staff
Line Managers are responsible for making the following staff aware of operational restrictions in order that they are able to
carry out their duties effectively:
•   •    Signallers
•   •    Train planners
•   •    Train Running Controllers and other VSTP planners
Other Control staff should also have access to information on operational restrictions.
For rolling stock restrictions which are not published in the Sectional Appendix the following methods may be used to
provide information on restrictions to the above staff:
•   •    Signal Box Notice
•   •    Copy of the RT3973 issued to train crew
•   •    Condition of Travel Notice (COTN) issued by Capacity Planning
•   •   COTN issued by the VSTP team (which may be a copy of the RT3973 reviewed and endorsed by the VSTP
    planner)
•   •    Copy of the Statement of Compatibility
Issuing a Statement of Compatibility to operational staff is non-preferred as they are complex, network-wide documents
and because multiple SoC may exist for the same rolling stock type (e.g. hauling or transfer moves, testing, passenger
operation). For regular passenger stock movements, the preferred approach is for Operations Managers to issue a Signal
Box Notice which details the restrictions for the rolling stock concerned until a stable gauging position is established
enabling publication in the Sectional Appendix.
Operations Managers will each maintain a defined set of arrangements for management and control of notices issued to
their signalling locations. These arrangements shall be documented and reviewed annually. The Head of Control shall do
the same for Control staff.
Use of Head Code to Advise Restriction
On Southern Region the following arrangements must be applied:
•   •    *X** used for services which operate with an RT3973EXL (Exceptional Loads traffic)
