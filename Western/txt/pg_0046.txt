Western Route Sectional Appendix Module WR1



Rule Book Module TW1 - Preparation and movement of
trains
Section 5, Clause 5.1 - Broken, distorted or damaged rails and broken fishplates
The following arrangements apply for the passage of trains over broken rails in the Western Route tunnels listed in the
table below.
A yellow handlamp will usually be placed in the four-foot at a distance of 5 metres (or 5 yards) on the approach side of the
rail defect to help the Driver locate the defectâ€™s position.
Unless it can be established for certain that a yellow lamp has been provided, the Driver will be instructed not to
exceed 5 mph throughout the length of the tunnel.
Trains on the adjacent lines will be stopped whenever a movement is authorised on the affected line and on other
occasions when the person inspecting the defect requests it.
