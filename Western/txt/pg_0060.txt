       Semaphore shunting signals that display a white light
       Certain semaphore shunting signals on Western and Wales Routes show a white light when the signal is in the ‘Normal’
       position, which means stop. However, provided the Signaller has given authority, the Driver may pass a signal in the
       ‘Normal’ position if it cannot be cleared to the ‘Proceed’ position for the route the movement is to take.


       Points Indicators
       At certain remote crossing loops on Western and Wales Route lines controlled by the NSTR system, points indicators
       show two white lights at an angle of 45˚ (i.e. similar to a position light signal when cleared) to indicate when the points are
       correctly set. Section 5.6 of Handbook RS/521 is modified accordingly. See also NSTR Regulations published separately.
