     (b) Emergency Speed Restrictions

    When it is necessary for an emergency speed restriction (ESR) to be imposed on an ATP-fitted line, the appropriate
    Control will, unless the ESR is caused by non-removal of a TSR at the published time, arrange for lineside ATP
    control equipment to be adjusted.

    This adjustment to the equipment will be in two phases :-

    (i) The Maintainer must immediately arrange to adjust the ATP track equipment. This involves inserting an ESR
    “plug” so that all ATP-fitted trains approaching the restriction will receive an immediately-recoverable emergency
    brake application, together with an “ESR” indication in the main cab display window. In these circumstances the
    target speed will be extinguished until the train has passed beyond the affected area. Supervision will however be
    maintained in respect of signal aspects, PSRs etc.

    The Technician making the adjustment must advise Control immediately the above first-phase adjustment has been
    completed.

    (ii) If the Emergency Speed Restriction is likely to continue for more than a few hours, Control must arrange
    production of TSR type ‘speed plugs’ which will provide the necessary speed supervision in respect of the ESR.

    This second-phase adjustment to the ATP equipment must be carried out as quickly as possible. The Technician
    making the adjustment must advise Control when this is done.

    Due to technical constraints, only one ‘speed plug’ per signal can be installed at a time and each plug can only be
    programmed to show one speed value. Therefore if an emergency speed restriction needs to be imposed which
    affects any section(s) already ‘plugged’ for a supervised TSR or ESR, the equipment will usually need to be adjusted
    so that Drivers receive “ESR” indications to cover both restrictions.
    (iii) Signallers will be advised by Control when an ATP-fitted service is running on ATP-fitted lines with AWS
    equipment isolated. In these circumstances the signaller must stop and caution such a train until the ATP ESR
    equipment has been adjusted.

    (iv) where an ESR already in place is changed, an advisory broadcast shall be made to notify drivers that this is the
    case. This broadcast should be maintained until the speed is returned to its original state, or drivers have been briefed
    through their late notice case.
    Work affecting track equipment
    ATP track equipment is susceptible to damage if treated roughly. All staff either working or walking on or near the line
    must take care not to displace, damage or otherwise interfere with ATP equipment.
    Engineering personnel have separately issued instructions covering the planning and carrying out of work on ATP
    fitted lines.If ATP track equipment requires to be out of use or temporarily unavailable due to engineering work,
    Drivers will be advised either by an item in the Weekly Operating Notice or by other suitable written notice.
