       Rule Book Module G1 - General safety responsibilities
       Section 5 - Communications procedure
       Using GSM-R berth triggered messages and non-verbal acknowledgements to caution Drivers
       A GSM-R berth triggered broadcast can be used to caution drivers for operational safety messages. Drivers must confirm receipt
       and acknowledge that they have clearly understood the broadcast by using the GSM-R ‘ST’ acknowledgement button. All GSM-R
       fitted trains in the area will receive these broadcasts. The berth-triggered safety broadcast process can be used in the following
       circumstances:
       Poor railhead conditions
       Animals on the line
       Defective Emergency Indicators
       Missing or Obscured Temporary Speed Restriction board
       Unusual events (Not Track or Signalling)
       Drivers of trains not fitted with version 3.5 GSM-R software may disregard the GSM-R berth-triggered safety broadcast.
       Methodology
       Signaller records the berth triggered safety broadcast to a set script and stores it on the system.
       Signaller sets up the berth triggered safety broadcast at the appropriate signal berth.
       Signaller maintains the protecting signal at danger. This is the signal where the signaller would stop and caution the train if an
       acknowledgement from drivers is not received.
       The safety broadcast will be made automatically to each train occupying the designated berth(s)
       Driver acknowledges that the safety broadcast has been received and that it has been understood by pressing the ‘ST’ button.
       The protecting signal is maintained at danger until the signaller receives an acknowledgement from the train concerned. The
       acknowledgement will be an ‘Acknowledgement’ (ACK) message from the driver.
       The protecting signal may be cleared when the signaller receives the acknowledgement message.
       If the acknowledgement message is not received the protecting signal will be maintained at danger.
       When the caution message is received and acknowledged by the driver, all signal aspects must be obeyed and the appropriate
       rules for the section of line concerned must be applied.
       Broadcast Message Content
       In all cases the message will begin : “This is a safety broadcast from the signaller at __________”
       Poor Railhead – “There are low/exceptionally poor* railhead conditions at/on* the approach to ________________.
       Animals on or near the line -There are animals on or near the line at/between* ___________ and* _________.
       Defective Emergency Indicators – “There is a defective emergency indicator for a ___ mph emergency speed restriction at
       ______________.
       Missing or obscured TSR board – There is a missing/obscured* warning board or speed indicator* for the ____ mph temporary
       speed restriction at _________**.
       Unusual events - +___________________”.
       + insert details of the incident, location and any speed restriction in the main body of the broadcast
       In all cases the message will end ‘Only acknowledge if you have fully understood this message. To acknowledge, press ST
       Button. End of safety broadcast’.
       * delete as appropriate
       ** insert name or location
       Note: If more than one TSR board is missing or obscured for a speed restriction then a berth triggered broadcast message cannot
       be used for this purpose
       Note: Unusual events and structure faults can include overcrowding on station platforms or loose canopies on stations platforms.
       These locations must be easily identifiable by both the signaller and the driver.
