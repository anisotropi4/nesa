       1.  Failure of white light
           If the white light on the "Stop" board fails to flash, the train may proceed over the crossing provided it has first
           been established that the barriers are fully lowered.
       2.  Failure of barriers to lower
           If the barriers fail to respond to depression of the “Lower” button, a second attempt must be made using the
           corresponding button on the other control unit at the crossing. If this is also unsuccessful the following action
           must be taken:
           (i)  Break the glass panel inside the control unit cupboard and obtain the emergency keys located therein.
           (ii) Go to the UP OFFSIDE barrier machine and, using the emergency keys, unlock the door of the barrier
                machine.
           (iii)Operate the “Normal/ Start Lights Sequence” switch in the barrier machine to the “Start Lights
                Sequence” position.
                This starts the usual road traffic signal sequence; but the audible warning device will not sound, nor will
                the barriers lower. A check must then be made to ensure that the red road traffic signals are flashing,
                and, when it is safe to do so, the Driver must be instructed to proceed. When the train has cleared the
                crossing the following action must be taken:
           (iv) Turn the switch in the Up Nearside barrier machine back to the “Normal” position.
           (v)  Ensure that the crossing has re-opened to road traffic.
           (vi) Relock the door to the barrier machine.
           (vii)Return the emergency keys to the control unit cupboard. BOTH CONTROL UNIT CUPBOARDS must
                then be relocked before the Shunter rejoins the train.
       3.  Failure of barriers and red road traffic signals
           In the event of the failure of the barriers and red road traffic signals, trains may pass over the crossing provided
           the Guard is satisfied it is safe to do so.
       4.  Failure of "BU" indication
           If the "BU" indication has not been illuminated by the time the train is about to pass it, the train must stop and the
           Guard must return to either of the cupboards and operate the "Raise" button on the control unit. Should this be
           unsuccessful, they must try the corresponding button on the other control unit.
           If after these attempts, one or more barriers fail to rise completely, the following action must be taken:-
           (i)  Break the glass panel inside the control unit cupboard and obtain the emergency keys.
           (ii) Using the emergency keys, unlock the door of the UP NEARSIDE barrier machine.
           (iii)Turn the switch in the barrier machine to the “Start Lights Sequence” position.
           (iv) Then proceed to the UP NEARSIDE barrier machine and unlock the door.
           (v)  Pull out the telescopic pump handle and pump the barrier up.
           (vi) When the barrier is fully raised, re-stow the pump handle and lock the barrier machine door.
           (vii)Repeat operations (iv) to (vi) at the DOWN OFFSIDE and DOWN NEARSIDE barriers.
           (viii)
                Finally return to the UP OFFSIDE barrier machine, pull out the telescopic pump handle and pump the
                barrier up.
           (ix) Ensure that the “Barriers Up” indication lamp in the control unit cupboard is illuminated.
           (x)  Re-stow the pump handle in the Up Offside barrier machine and turn the switch back to the “Normal”
                position.
           (xi) Relock the door to the Up Nearside barrier machine.
           (xii)Return the emergency keys to the control unit cupboard, which must then be relocked before the
                Shunter rejoins the train.
