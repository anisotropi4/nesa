Kingsland Road Sidings

The Person in Charge (PiC) of any movement to/from these sidings must make sure that all hand points are correctly set
for the movement, and that an incoming movement can pass clear of the main line without delay.
All through sidings (3, 5 and 8) are in use as construction site for the assembly of track panels and storage of materials
associated with the future remodelling of Bristol East Junction.
The construction site is protected by sleepers secured across the rails (and a red light) at either end.

                                                                                                           Dated: 29/11/2020

Shunting movements – station area. The following is a list of preferred shunting routes that will be used where more than
one route is available.
Where only one shunting route is available, or where due to the nature of the location, liaison between the Signaller and
the Driver always precedes any movement, no preferred shunting route is listed.
Where a shunt is not listed, the Driver and Signaller must reach a clear understanding as to the limits of the movement
and the signals at which the train will reverse behind
