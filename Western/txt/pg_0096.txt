       GSM-R BLANKET SPEED RESTRICTION BROADCAST
       RS523.8.3, GERT80000/SP-6, - GERT8000/G1.5
       Where a blanket speed restriction is to be imposed, an additional berth triggered advisory broadcast shall be made on
       approach to the restriction. This is in addition to drivers being advised by the late notice of by other means. (where a
       blanket speed is applied at short notice). An acknowledgement is not required for this broadcast. The broadcast shall

       This is an advisory broadcast from the signaller at______ As previously issued, due to _____ a blanket speed restriction
       of _______MPH has been imposed between _____ & _____
       End of advisory broadcast.
