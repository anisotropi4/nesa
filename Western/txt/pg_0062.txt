       CLASS 220/221 TRAINS WORKING ON REDUCED
       TRACTION POWER
         1.Four-car units with at least two engines, and five-car units with at least three engines available for traction may
           operate on Western Route without restriction. Trains consisting of more than one unit must have the equivalent
           ratio of engines available throughout the train.
         2.Assistance must be provided for five-car units with only two engines available for traction over the sections of line
           listed in clause 4 below. Elsewhere on Western Route, such trains may operate unassisted provided the relevant
           Fleet Controller agrees in each case.
         3.Before working over the sections of line listed in clause 4 below, all effort must be made to restore traction power
           by the last booked stopping point. If this cannot be done but the minimum number of engines shown in clause 1
           above remains available, the train may proceed unassisted. Operations Control must be told what is to happen
           and if at all possible must arrange with the Signaller concerned for an unchecked run to be made over the
           relevant incline(s).
         4.Unless sufficient engines per unit shown in clause 1 are available for traction, Class 220/ 221 trains must be
           assisted when working over the following sections of line:
           •    Newton Abbot to Plymouth
           •    Plymouth to Newton Abbot (train may proceed as far as Tavistock Jn if this would facilitate assistance)
           •    Paignton to Newton Abbot
           •    Par to St. Austell

         5.In all cases the arrangements must be agreed between TOC Control and Operations Control.
