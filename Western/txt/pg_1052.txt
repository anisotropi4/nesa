GW915 - GWAUN-CAE-GURWEN TO PANTYFFYNNON
Gwaun-cae-Gurwen Colliery Ground Frame
This ground frame controls a connection from the running line towards a short headshunt. The points must normally be set
towards the headshunt to derail vehicles running away from the colliery. The ground frame is released by a key attached
to the ‘one train working’ train staff.
Drivers of up arriving trains must hand the train staff to the Person in Charge (PiC) at the Up direction ‘STOP’ board at
Gwaun-cae-Gurwen Colliery level crossing.
The PiC must then reverse the ground frame and set the points for Gwaun-cae-Gurwen sidings before authorising drivers
to pass the STOP board and proceed across the level crossing. When the train has passed clear of the points complete
with tail lamp, the PiC must return the ground frame to the normal position and hand the train staff to the Driver.
Drivers of down trains must hand the train staff to the PiC before departure who must reverse the ground frame and set
the points for the single line. The PiC must then authorise the driver to draw forward and bring the train to a stand at the
‘STOP’ board protecting Gwaun-cae-Gurwen A474 level crossing.
The PiC must return the ground frame to the normal position, remove the train staff and proceed to Gwaun-cae-Gurwen
A474 level crossing to meet the Driver.
