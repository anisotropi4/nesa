     ALSTOM OLD OAK COMMON DEPOT (VIA BLACK LINE)

     Arrivals
     All arrivals will require the NR signaller to obtain the slot on SN6083 from the Alstom Depot Operations Controller (DOC). To
     obtain the slot, the signaller will contact the DOC to request the release when the driver has changed ends in preparation for
     routing onto the depot. In order to give the slot, the DOC must set the route from SN6083 to the stop blocks on the depot.
     For timetabled arrivals, ARS has the ability to set the route into the depot once the slot has been obtained.
     A 9 car Class 345 stood at SN6083 signal is foul of 8077 and 8076 points.
     If a driver is stood at SN6083 while at danger, they are to use the SG button to send a message to the Network Rail signaller.
     The signaller shall then set the route at the earliest possibility.
     Departures
     All departures will require the DOC to obtain the slot on SN6096 from the NR signaller. To obtain the slot, the DOC will call the
     NR signaller before the planned time of departure to request the release.
     Once the slot is obtained, the DOC will only set the route provided this does not result in any timetable clashes at the depot.
     If the departure is timetabled, ARS has the ability to set the route from SN6080.
     A 9 car Class 345 stood at SN6080 signal is foul of 7000 and 7001 points on the Washer Bypass Line and 7004 points on Depot
     Line 1.
     If a driver is stood at SN6080 while at danger, they are to use the SG button to send a message to the NR signaller. The
     signaller shall then set the route at the earliest possible opportunity.
