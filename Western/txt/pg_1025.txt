       Restricted clearances exist between certain trains and infrastructure on this section of the line. The operation of a
       Departmental or passenger train movement that includes within the formation any former passenger carrying vehicles with
       drop light windows (including Mark 2 air conditioned vehicles), requiring to operate between Cardiff Central and Barry
       Island (in either direction), is authorised to proceed subject to the timely and formal issue of a Special Notice to all parties
       that MUST include the following:
       The Person in Charge of the train must ensure that all droplight windows are closed and that they remain closed.
       The Person in Charge of the train must also ensure that the persons occupying the vehicles have been advised not to lean
       out or extend anything out of any window.
       In connection with the operation of a train comprised of Mark 2 air conditioned vehicles, the organiser must arrange for
       Stewards to be positioned at each door of every vehicle to enforce the restriction.
       The Person in Charge of the train must brief everyone on board, including the Train Crew, to ensure these instructions are
       adhered to.
       Compliance to the above especially amends ‘Table D3 – Route clearance of coaching stock’ as published in Module
       NWRC of the Western Sectional Appendix.
