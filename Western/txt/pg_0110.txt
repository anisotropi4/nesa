         Except as detailed in Section (b)(iv), provided it is confirmed that all boards and warning equipment for as ESR are
         provided in accordance with Rulebook Module SP, there is no requirement for the controlling Signaller to advise ATP
         fitted trains before the ATP track equipment is adjusted.

         Due to technical constraints, only one ‘speed plug’ per signal can be installed at a time and each plug can only be
         programmed to show one speed value. Therefore if an emergency speed restriction needs to be imposed which
         affects any section(s) already ‘plugged’ for a supervised TSR or ESR, the equipment will usually need to be adjusted
         so that Drivers receive “ESR” indications to cover both restrictions.
         (iii) Signallers will be advised by Control when an ATP-fitted service is running on ATP-fitted lines with AWS
         equipment isolated. In these circumstances the signaller must stop and caution such a train until the ATP ESR
         equipment has been adjusted.
         (b) Emergency Speed Restrictions
         (iv) Where an TSR or ESR already in place is changed to a more restrictive speed and the ATP track equipment has
         not been updated to give the correct supervision, an advisory broadcast must be made to notify drivers of the change
         in speed. This broadcast must be maintained until either the speed is returned to its original state, or the ATP track
         equipment is adjusted to give the correct supervision for the altered arrangements.

       11. Work affecting track equipment

         ATP track equipment is susceptible to damage if treated roughly. All staff either working or walking on or near the line
         must take care not to displace, damage or otherwise interfere with ATP equipment.

         Engineering personnel have separately issued instructions covering the planning and carrying out of work on ATP
         fitted lines.

         If ATP track equipment requires to be out of use or temporarily unavailable due to engineering work, Drivers will be
         advised either by an item in the Weekly Operating Notice or by other suitable written notice.
