When a COSS/PC wishes to take a line blockage of the lines described below, they will call the signaller in the normal
manner. The signaller will then give the COSS/PC permission to activate the RTCOD and then observe that the
appropriate track circuit(s) have activated, prior to issuing the associated authority number. Once the work has been
completed, the signaller must observe that the track circuit shows clear and normal indications are obtained before
returning to normal working.
If there is a track circuit failure when the RTCOD has not been intentionally activated, the following procedure must be
applied.
    â€¢    The signaller will report the track circuit failure in the normal manner
