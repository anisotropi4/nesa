       GW750 - HEREFORD/BRECON CURVE GF TO MEB SIDING
       Entire Line Of Route
       Trains propelled from Hereford to Bulmers/MEB sidings must have a brake van, equipped with Guard's brake valve and
       klaxon, as the leading vehicle; the Shunter must ride in this van and operate the klaxon as necessary. The brake van
       must NOT have a stove. Propelled movements must not exceed 5 mph.
       Radio contact must be maintained between the Shunter and the Driver, and if contact is lost the Driver must STOP
       immediately. Messages must be preceded by the call signs "Brecon Curve Shunter to Brecon Curve Driver" or vice versa,
       as appropriate, and must be acknowledged by repetition. Before the propelling movement commences a successful radio
       test must be made between brake van and locomotive. Only the authorised radios may be used on this line.
       The train staff for the Hereford Yard - Bulmers gate section is kept in Hereford Signal Box. The keys for Burcott Road
       Level Crossing gates and to Bulmers gate/train staff cupboard are attached to the train staff.
       The Shunter must advise the Person in Charge at MEB sidings when a train is ready to leave Hereford Yard.
       On arrival at the "Stop" board outside Bulmers gate the Shunter must:-
       Unlock and open the gate,
       unlock the cupboard and obtain the train staff for Bulmers siding (trains must NOT proceed further without this train staff),
       ensure that the foot crossing is clear and inform the Driver, by radio, that the Bulmers train staff (which may be carried in
         the brake van) has been obtained and that the train may proceed.
       The gate must be closed and locked after the train has passed through.
       On arrival at the "Stop" board outside the MEB gate, the Shunter must obtain authority from the MEB representative
       before instructing the Driver, by radio, that the train may proceed.
       On the return journey, at the "Stop" board inside Bulmers gate, the Shunter must : -
       Unlock and open the gate,
       unlock the cupboard and replace the train staff for Bulmers siding, relock the cupboard,
       ensure that the foot crossing is clear and inform the Driver that the train may proceed.
       The gate must be closed and locked after the train has passed through.
       Should a train become disabled or divided on the single line, the Driver must retain possession of the train staff until the
       whole of the train has been removed from the single line. The Shunter must arrange for the necessary assistance and
       personally accompany the assisting engine; in these circumstances, the Driver of an assisting engine may enter the single
       line without the train staff.

       GW773 - MACHEN QUARRY TO PARK JUNCTION
       Machen Quarry Siding
       All Trains arriving must contact the signaller at Park Junction.
       As soon as the train arrives.
       The train is ready to depart the siding.
       The inlet and outlet connections are set for through running over the single line and are worked by single lever ground
       frames released by an “Annets Key” which is attached to the train staff.
       Trains entering Machen Quarry siding via the outlet connection must be brought to a stand by the driver when inside the
       ground frame trap point.
       The trap point must be clipped and padlocked by the shunter before any facing movements are made towards Park
       Junction signal box.
       In the event of any maintenance work required on the single line, the PC (Protection Controller) will obtain the train staff
       from the driver. The transfer of train staff can only take place when the train is stabled and both trap points have been
       secured by the shunter in the Machen Quarry siding.
       The PC (Protection Controller) will then arrange a line blockage with the signaller at Park Junction.
       Loading can then also take place on the Machen Quarry siding.
       On completion of any maintenance work the PC (Protection Controller) will cancel the line blockage with the signaller at
       Park Junction and hand the train staff back to the driver.
                                                           Dated: 25/12/21
