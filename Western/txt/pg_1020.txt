       • take any other possible action to stop any approaching train
       • tell the PiC what has happened.
       Except if it is necessary to examine the line, another train must not be allowed to proceed on the obstructed line until it has
       been established that the obstruction has been removed.
       When the obstruction has been removed, or a train can pass clear of the obstruction, normal working may then be
       resumed.
       Train or vehicles proceeding without authority (including a SPAD)
       If a train or vehicle proceeds without authority, or has entered the section without authority, the signaller will :
       • place or keep the signals at danger
       • if necessary, arrange for train radio messages to be sent
       • take any other possible action to reduce the risk of a collision.
       • tell the PiC what has happened
       If the train or vehicle proceeding without authority enters the section behind a train already in the section, the signaller will
       :
       • if possible, allow the first train to pass, and then
       • immediately replace the signals to danger against the train which is proceeding without authority.
       When the next train is ready to enter the section, the train will be signalled normally. The signaller will :
       • tell the driver what has happened
       • instruct the driver to proceed through the section at caution.
       If the train or vehicle proceeding without authority enters the section when there is no other train in that section, and
       arrives complete, the driver or PiC as appropriate, must press the ‘train arrived complete’ button. The next train will be
       signalled normally.
       Train divided
       If it is suspected that a train has become divided, the signaller will place or keep the signals at danger against the divided
       train. If necessary, train radio messages will be sent. The PiC will be told what has happened.
       The signaller will not allow another train to enter any affected section until :
       • it is established that the section is not obstructed, or
       • the line is to be examined.
       Train passed without tail lamp
       If a train has arrived without a tail lamp, the ‘train arrived complete’ button must not be pressed.
       If the train is complete, the ‘train arrived complete’ button may be pressed and the signaller must be told that the train is
       complete. If the train is not complete, the signaller and PiC must come to a clear understanding of the actions to be taken
       depending on the circumstances.
       If a train has passed with a portable tail lamp on the rear, but it is out, the ‘train arrived complete’ button must be pressed
       and the signaller advised.
       Allowing an assisting train into an occupied section
       The signaller may allow an assisting train to enter an occupied section in either direction to :
       • proceed to, and assist, a failed train
       • evacuate passengers from a failed train
       • remove a portion of a divided train
       • remove vehicles that have proceeded without authority.
       Before allowing an assisting train to enter the occupied section, the signaller and driver must reach a clear understanding
       of the location of the failed train or vehicles and agree which end of the section the failed train will be assisted to.
       Before authorising the driver of the assisting train to enter the occupied section, the signaller will tell the PiC the
       description of the assisting train and what is to happen. When the assisting train enters the occupied section, the signaller
       will tell the PiC.
