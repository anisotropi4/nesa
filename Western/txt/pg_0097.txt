These trains are authorised to transit between their operating bases and engineering possessions in excess of
the normal route length limits on Western and Wales Routes provided that a suitable train path has been
identified.

The train identification used and maximum lengths (including locomotives) are as follows:

HOBC            6Y07 or 6Y15    127 SLUs        811 metres       887 yards       2659 feet

Company manning agreements and equipped with back to back radios.
