       The Person in Charge (PiC) of any movement to/from these sidings must make sure that all hand points are correctly set
       for the movement, and that an incoming movement can pass clear of the main line without delay.
       All through sidings (3, 5 and 8) are in use as construction site for the assembly of track panels and storage of materials
       associated with the future remodelling of Bristol East Junction.
       The construction site is protected by sleepers secured across the rails (and a red light) at either end.
       The PiC must arrange for a release of the ground frame when a train which is to be run to the sidings arrives at Down
       Main line position-light signal BL6653 (by the ground frame).

       The maximum length of any movement must not exceed the length shown in the data table below:

       BL6681.

       The PiC of any movement due to arrive in the sidings must reach a clear understanding with the PiC of any movement
       already taking place in the siding.
