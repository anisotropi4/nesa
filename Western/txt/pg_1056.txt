                      Western Route Sectional Appendix Module WR2



       When a Down train has crossed an Up train, the Guard/Driver of the Up train must always wait until the barrier raising
       sequence has been fully completed after the passage of a down train before operating the control unit to lower them again.
       If a train does not proceed over the crossing within 7 minutes of initiating Lower sequence, either by pulling the cab wire or
       by pressing the Lower button, the Driverâ€™s White light, if lit, will be extinguished and 30 seconds there after the barriers will
       rise. Drivers are required to wait till the barriers have raised completely. In this instance, subsequent attempts to initiate the
       crossing sequence will not lower the barriers until attended by NR staff. Drivers must inform the Signaller at Pantyffynnon
       Signal Box and follow instruction 3 above.
