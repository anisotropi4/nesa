       STATIONS WITH SHORT PLATFORMS
       The length of each station platform is shown in metres and yards on table A pages published in this appendix. Provided
       the train concerned can be fully platformed, all doors can be used without restriction. Trains exceeding the published
       platform length may call in any of the following circumstances :

         • selective door release / isolation is available which allows passengers to use platformed doors only

         • where a train is fitted with a “local door / intermediate facility”, this must be used to allow passengers to board /
           alight from the leading door of the train. If use of the leading door is not practicable, the guard must come to a
           clear understanding with the driver as to the positioning of the train to allow an alternative door to be platformed,
           prior to the “local door / intermediate facility” being used to release this door only. Guards must take extreme
           care at such stations to ensure only doors fully adjacent to the platform are released

         • the extremities of the train are off the platform but all passenger doors are platformed

         • where Train Operating Company instructions state that unplatformed doors or units must be locked out of
           passenger use for all or part of the journey

         • where the Train Operating Company instructions state that special arrangements have been made for the
           operation of charter trains using slam door stock to prevent passengers detraining from unplatformed coaches

         • a platform has been temporarily shortened for engineering / reconstruction work and special arrangements have
           been made and published

         • evacuating a train in emergency.

       STOPPING POSITION AT PASSENGER PLATFORMS
       Some station platforms have marker signs to indicate where Drivers should stop passenger trains of certain formations.
       The signs are black or blue and show a numeral or group of numerals above the words Car Stop (e.g. “3 Car Stop” or “2 3
       4 Car Stop”). Some signs show “S Car Stop”.
       The Driver of each stopping passenger (and unless otherwise instructed ECS) trains must stop with the front cab at the
       appropriate sign for the formation of the train. Where “S Car Stop” signs are provided, all trains must stop with the leading
       cab at the sign regardless of length.
       Unless varied by instructions elsewhere in this Appendix, the Driver of a train that is overlength for a platform in Western
       Route must stop with the leading coaches platformed.
