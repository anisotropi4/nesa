                                      NT1369
                             Up direction
                                      NT1366

       The relieving of trains on the Down and Up Relief lines is BANNED. If a train requiring relief is unavoidably routed towards
       either of these lines it must continue forward to the most suitable point beyond Newport where relief may be safely
       effected.
       The Signaller, Traincrew Supervisor and Traincrew must liaise to ensure relief arrangements are completed promptly. The
       TCS must ensure that the Signaller is advised when any train not shown in the WTT for relief at Newport is so required to
       call.
       Newport Tunnel. An up direction sign is provided in the six foot, 15 yards on the approach to signal NT1646, situated
       between the Up and Down Main lines just inside the Newport end tunnel portal. The sign consists of a white retro-
       reflective board with a black border with the words ‘Stopping Point’ in black letters.
       Drivers approaching signal NT1646 at Danger must bring their trains to a stand on the approach to this sign.

       Due to exceptionally low wire height on ALL lines between OLE structures SWM/232/965 and SWM/233/084, no work
       shall be undertaken on any line when the overhead line equipment is live unless:
       1) it is not reasonably practicable when the overhead line equipment is live AND
       2) the specific task is judged as “low risk” by a competent person.
