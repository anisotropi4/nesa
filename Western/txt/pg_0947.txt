Barriers Up (BU) Indicators
For trains over 1260 ft (60 SLUâ€™s), the driver will not be able to see the BU indicator illuminate.
On arrival at the Stop boards, the driver should ensure that there is a competent person in attendance before proceeding.
The competent person must observe that the train has passed clear of the crossing, the barriers are in the raised position
and the crossing is open to road traffic.
In these circumstances the driver can then disregard the BU indicator.
                                                                                                        Dated: 30/01/21

Jn where the Trainman/Shunter must ensure that the points are set correctly and that no conflicting movements are taking
place, the train may then proceed onto the Tytherington branch where the locomotive must run-round.
The locomotive must not pass the "Stop" board on the Outgoing line until an assurance has been received from the
Signaller that no conflicting movement has been signalled from signal B609. The train may depart via the Incoming line on
