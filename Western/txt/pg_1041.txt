       Cardiff

       The following is a list of preferred shunting routes that will be used where more than one route is available.
       Where a shunt is not listed, the Driver and Signaller must reach a clear understanding as to the limits of the movement
       and the signals at which the train will reverse behind.
       Location Shunt details â€“ Cardiff Central Station all Platforms
                Route via Line E to signal CF2239 and reverse behind CF7048
                (NB: Route NOT electrified. Shunt move available to diesel traction only)
                Route via Line A to Limit of Shunt CF7051and reverse behind CF2342
                (Route fully electrified up to limit of shunt)
       Cardiff Central
                Route via Line A to the Brickyard Siding and reverse behind CF2344
       (West end)
                (Route fully electrified up to buffer stop)

                Note: The above two routes are the only shunt moves available to electric traction. All other routes
                are provided with only minimal OLE as part of over-run protection, and are thus not available for use
                by electric traction.

       Cardiff Intersection Bridges (East Jn Viaduct)

       Restrictions on passage of steam trains.
       Due to an exceptionally low wire height on ALL lines through Cardiff Intersection Bridges:
       The King Class steam locomotive MUST be routed via Line D only through the bridges (but may then use either platform
       at Cardiff).
       Other steam locomotives may use any line, but shall be routed via Line D by preference, as this has greatest clearance.
       If an OLE tripping event occurs during the passage of a steam locomotive under the bridges, that line (only) shall be
       blocked indefinitely to any further steam locomotives, and advice sought from the Route Asset Manager (E&P).
       Trains must not stop with any locomotive in steam under any part of the bridges.
       NB: This restriction is greater than the normal restriction on avoidance of stopping under an OLE bridge arm. The bridge
       deck has a specialist coating on it that may be damaged by a stationary steam train.
       If a steam locomotive does stop under the bridge, that line (only) shall be blocked indefinitely to any further steam trains,
       and this shall be reported to the Route Asset Manager (E&P) for an inspection of the coating to be carried out.
       The above advice is applicable to these classes of steam locomotive:
       A1 60163 Tornado
       A4 Class
       BR Standard Class 7 (Britannia)
       Braunton
       Castle Class (GWR Castle)
       LMS 8F
       LMS Royal Scot Class
       LMS Stanier Class 5 (Black 5)
       King Class
       If any other classes of steam locomotive are being planned to pass under the bridges, the advice of the Route Asset
       Manager (E&P) shall be sought at the planning stage.
