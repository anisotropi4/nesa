GW103 â€“ PADDINGTON TO UFFINGTON
NORTH POLE DEPOT
Arrival
ARS will normally route an approaching train to North Pole Depot Line B (or via a secondary route from North Pole Depot
Line A, to North Pole Depot Line B) signal SN119.
The PIC must make sure that there is enough room to accommodate the approaching train in the transfer siding
concerned before entering the head code in to the depot train describer. No conflicting movement is allowed until the
approaching train has arrived in the transfer siding.
In exceptional circumstances, or if congestion would otherwise block the Down Main line or Line 1, arrivals are permitted
on North Pole Depot Line A (which allows direct access to transfer sidings 1 and 2 only). The signaller will get permission
from the PIC before setting the route.
Departure
The PIC must interpose the train description in the depot train describer for the transfer siding(s) concerned.
Provided the train concerned is stopped at the transfer siding exit signal, the train description has been entered in to the
depot train describer by the PIC, and no conflicting movement has been authorised, ARS (or the signaller) will set the
route.
For non-timetable trains leaving the depot, the PIC must interpose the head code into the depot train describer and tell the
signaller. The signaller will set the route to allow the train to leave the transfer siding concerned.
