       Dynamic Risk Assessment
       The purpose of DRA is to provide a continuous assessment of risk in the rapidly changing circumstances of an operational
       incident, in order to implement control measures necessary to make certain of an acceptable level of safety.
       Its application should be applied by operational management staff seeking to assess operational system risk, and identify
       control measures that deliver a safety benefit in rapidly changing operational incidents affecting the normal operation of
       the railway.
       DRA can only be facilitated and implemented by those trained to do so.

       ELECTRIC POINT HEATERS
       The point heaters at certain locations function automatically but may, in addition, be switched on manually by authorised
       persons if conditions require this to be done. Access to the electrical equipment cabinet is by a BR 222 Key. The
       "Off/Manual/Remote" Switch should be turned to the Manual position and the cabinet re-locked. The Infrastructure Fault
       Control staff must be advised at the first opportunity when this has been done.
       In no circumstances may staff operate or alter any other apparatus in the cabinet.
