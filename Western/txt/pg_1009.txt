       Use of ZKL300RC Remote Control Track Circuit Operating Device (RTCOD)
       A COSS/PC wishes to take a line blockage of the Up Main/Up Loop beyond LM105, they will call
       the signaller in the normal manner. The signaller will then give the COSS/PC permission to activate the RTCOD and then
       observe that the track circuit “AJ” activates, prior to issuing the associated authority number. Once the work has been
       completed, the signaller must observe that the track circuit shows clear and normal indications are obtained before
       returning to normal working.
       If there is a track circuit failure when the RTCOD has not been intentionally activated, the following procedure must be
       applied.
       • The signaller will report the track circuit failure in the normal manner
       • The signaller will then carry out the applicable rules and regulations for the movement of subsequent trains until such a
         time that normal running can resume.
