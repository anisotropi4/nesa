       DIRECT-LINE TELEPHONES
       Where telephone circuits are grouped on certain recently renewed telephone concentrators, there is NO engaged tone if a
       call is started whilst another telephone in the same group is in use.
       This situation is normal. If no ringing or engaged tone is heard initially, it probably means that another line in that group is
       being used. The caller must hang up and try again in thirty seconds. Unless you still cannot get through after two or
       three attempts, do NOT assume that the telephone has failed.
       Reminder stickers are provided at the telephones concerned.

       The operation of DOO (NP) trains is permitted on all lines controlled by Network Rail Western route.
       Empty passenger coaching stock trains must be fitted with power doors or central door locking. DOO (NP) working is
       permitted with defective passenger doors provided that they have been locked out of use.
       Some lines have equipment such as level crossings and ground frames, or particular methods of working which require a
       second member of Train Operating Company staff to be present. Personnel involved in the planning of DOO (NP)
       movements must take this into account.
