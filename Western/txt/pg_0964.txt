       "Set Back" Indicators. Propelling movements made from the East end entering the "Up and Down" Loop line via position
       light signal W782 prior to running-round must be brought to a stand immediately the locomotive has reached the Taunton
       side of signal W249.
       No further movement must be made until the Guard/Shunter has operated the plunger fixed to a post opposite the loop
       line station platform. Depression of the plunger illuminates three double-sided white light indicators, provided at intervals
       of approximately 150 yards beside the loop line. The Guard/Shunter must keep the plunger depressed while the lights are
       required to be illuminated. When the leading vehicle of the movement has reached the plunger post the plunger must be
       released. When the train is at a stand the Guard/Shunter must advise the Signaller.
       The Driver may commence propelling as soon as the lights are illuminated. The movement must be driven from the
       leading (Taunton end) cab at a maximum speed of 3 mph, and the Driver must be prepared to stop the movement
       immediately the lights are extinguished.
       Trains being propelled under these arrangements prior to running-round must not exceed 32 SLUs inclusive of locomotive
       (and brake van where provided). The indicator equipment must be in working order and the movement may only be
       carried out in clear weather.
       In all other circumstances the train must run-round at an alternative location.
