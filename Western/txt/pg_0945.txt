GW430 - YATE MIDDLE JN TO TYTHERINGTON
Tytherington - Continued

Shunting
Extreme care must be taken when shunting due to severe gradients. The only shunting operations permitted are:
Removal of red-carded wagons
Attachment of repaired wagons
Remarshalling in order to comply with Brake Regulations
Any spare / crippled vehicles left at Tytherington, must have all handbrakes applied.
The vehicles left on the quarry loading road are not considered as part of the OTW section
Departing Trains
The ground staff/traincrew must ensure that before departure that any loose material/stone that could fall from wagons is
removed prior to departure and arrange with the HTS for this to be done. Until the ground staff/traincrew are satisfied that
the material concerned has been removed, the train must not be permitted to depart.
Trains must depart from the Loading Siding only. The ground staff/traincrew is responsible for authorising the Driver to
pass the outgoing “Stop – Await Instructions” board.
