Rule Book Module TW3 - Preparation and movement of
locomotive-hauled trains
Section 8 - Incidents involving exterior doors
The rule must apply also to HST Power Car sliding doors. The TOC concerned must tell Operations Control about any
services on which Power Car sliding doors are secured out of use. Should it be necessary to secure any Power Car
sliding door out of use, the sliding door on the opposite side of the train must also be secured out of use.
Only one Power Car on which the sliding doors are secured out of use may be formed in a set except when specially
authorised by Operations Control. Should the Power Car sliding window also be defective, the set must not be allowed in
service.
Access must be maintained from the adjacent trailer vehicle to the Power Car.
