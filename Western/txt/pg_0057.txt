         2.Under certain bulb failure conditions it is possible for a single yellow to be shown in each head â€“ i.e. displayed as
           2 yellows horizontally. This must be treated as a caution, i.e. be prepared to stop at next signal.
         3.When both the directing distant and the junction signal are cleared, the normal 4 aspect sequence is shown for
           the route set, a single yellow aspect is shown for the route that is not set.
         4.There are signals where the splitting distant feature is not associated with a danger aspect, i.e. the signal only
           shows distant signal aspects and the red (example a) is omitted.


       Loading/ unloading indicators
       Where these signals are provided at terminals and yards on Western Route, each indication means as follows:

               Move slowly in the normal direction for loading or unloading

               (three steady vertical white lights)




               Move slowly in the opposite direction as for loading or unloading

               (three flashing white lights at 45 degrees)




               Prepare to stop

               (three steady white lights at 45 degrees)




               Stop immediately, regardless of distance from the indicator

               (three horizontal lights; two outer reds, one middle white)




       The indicators are unlit when not in use. At some locations, certain of the above aspects are not used. See also local
       instructions in this Appendix.
