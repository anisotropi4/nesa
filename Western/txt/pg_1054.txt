Permissive Working Arrangements
Working with IET’s
A 5 car IET is permitted to share a platform with another train providing the IET is the first train in the platform, Theron
normal permissive working rules should apply as below.
When a designated competent person is on the platform
The signaller must not signal a second train into an occupied platform until they have received confirmation the first train is
at a stand, complete with tail lamp and there is enough room for the whole of the second train to be within the platform and
within the control of CJ12 or CJ15 as appropriate to the movement.
Should you become aware there is not a competent person on duty you must inform the Train Running Controller.
When no designated competent person is on the platform
Booked Permissive movements should be suspended when an alternative platform is available, and trains may then be
signalled normally into the unoccupied platform.
When both platforms are already occupied and it becomes necessary to permissively signal another train into an occupied
platform you must have first received confirmation from a driver of a train already occupying a platform that he is at a
stand, complete with tail lamp and there is sufficient room for the second train to fit in the platform within the control of
CJ12 or CJ15 as appropriate to the movement.
When you have received confirmation there is sufficient room for the movement you may signal the train normally into the
platform.
This arrangement will apply for one permissive movement only. When this has occurred, you must advise the Train
Running Controller of the circumstances and that subsequent movements will only be made into an unoccupied platform
and permissive working has been suspended.
                                                                                                           Dated: 19/06/2021
