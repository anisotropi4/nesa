Use of ZKL 300 RC Remote Control Track Circuit Operating Device
When a COSS/PC wishes to take a line blockage, they will call the signaller to discuss in the normal manner. The
Signaller will give permission to the COSS/PC to activate the RTCOD and observe the following track circuits DA on the
Down Main or BG on the Up Main, to confirm it activates prior to issuing the associated authority number. Once the work
has been completed, the signaller must observe the track circuit so that normal indications are obtained
If there is a track circuit failure when the RTCOD has not been intentionally activated the following procedure must be
applied:
The Signaller will report the Track Circuit as a fault in the normal manner.
The Signaller will then carry out the applicable rules and regulations for the movement of subsequent trains until such a
time that normal running of trains can be resumed.
