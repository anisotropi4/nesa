GSM-R GENERAL INSTRUCTION
TW5 SECTION 25 – KNOWN SEARCHING NETWORK LOCATIONS
The locations in the table below have encountered a temporary reduction in radio coverage with the GSM-R system which
may result in registration problems and the ability of the driver to contact the signaller. This will be presented to the Driver
on the DCP as ‘searching for network’.

Drivers must carry out the ‘Pending Registration’ process on the radio and continue their journey.

LIMITED COVERAGE ON FREIGHT ONLY BRANCH LINES
The freight-only branch lines listed in the table below are sections of permanent poor GSM-R coverage. These areas of
poor coverage are in tunnels and deep cuttings resulting in GSM-R calls may be unreliable, as with previous NRN
coverage. If a train is in a poor coverage area at the time the emergency call is initiated, the train radio will receive the
emergency call as soon as there is sufficient GSM-R coverage.

GSM-R FAULTS AND FAILURES RESPONSE

VERSION 1.1

PURPOSE

To provide guidance on the response to onboard GSM-R system faults and local/area infrastructure faults.

Appendix 1 covers the response to system faults from a single fixed terminal through to failures of the infrastructure
resulting in loss of coverage in a geographical area.
