       Use of ZKL300RC Remote Control Track Circuit Operating Device (RTCOD)
       A COSS/PC wishes to take a Line blockage of the Up / Down Branch, they will call the signaller in the normal manner. The
       signaller will then give the COSS/PC permission to activate the RTCOD and then observe that the track circuit CY
       activates, prior to issuing the associated authority number. Once the work has been completed, the signaller must observe
       that the track circuit shows clear and normal indications are obtained before returning to normal working.
       If there is a track circuit failure when the RTCOD has not been intentionally activated, the following procedure must be
       applied
       The signaller will report the track circuit failure in the normal manner
       The signaller will then carry out the applicable rules and regulations for the movement of subsequent trains until such a
       time that normal running can resume.

       St Brides Carrier Wire Neutral Section (CWNS)

       The Carrier Wire Neutral Section (CWNS) at St Brides consists of a series of dead overhead line wire overlaps that enable
       trains to transition from one feeding area to another unhindered. The average length of the arrangement is 300m.
       Additional signage is provided to aid drivers transitioning through the section as to where the start and end of the neutral
       section occurs.
       When cautioning trains from NT1081 (DM) or NT1279 (DR) or NT1082 (UM) or NT1280 (UR), drivers should be reminded
       of the presence of the CWNS to ensure a sufficient speed is obtained throughout in order to prevent the stranding of
       trains.
