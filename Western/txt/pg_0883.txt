All movements to and from the lines listed above are under the control of the Temple Meads signaller (Didcot, TVSC).
The driver must get permission from the signaller to make a movement within these sidings, including proceeding towards
position-light signal BL6719 when due to leave the sidings.
Trains or vehicles entering these sidings must reverse behind and then be routed from position-light signal BL6720.
Vehicles must be stabled as close to the buffer stops as possible and also left clear of connections to other sidings.
The hand point leading to the Fish Dock Engineering Compound is normally secured for movements to/from the Motor
Rail Dock Siding. The padlock key is kept by the engineering department (Delivery Unit, Bristol).

stop on the station side of the gantry before running to the siding. The driver may accept a route to the West Carriage
Line (route indication - letter C).
