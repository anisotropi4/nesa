Western Route Sectional Appendix Module WR1




Rule Book Module SS1 - Station duties and train
dispatch
Starting of trains with a Guard from staffed platforms
At the stations listed below in Sectional Appendix line of route order, staff must give the necessary STATION WORK
COMPLETE and READY-TO-START handsignals using a white dispatch baton by day and a white light by night or in bad
visibility.
Guards must understand that a white baton or light held above the head is their only authority to give the READY TO
START signal to the Driver at staffed platforms, and must clearly acknowledge each handsignal by raising one arm above
the head.
The READY TO START signal to the Driver may then be given in accordance with the Rule Book and with any local
instructions that may be shown elsewhere in this Appendix.
Where station staff are not in attendance at a station listed in these instructions as being staffed, the instructions contained
in Rule Book, Module SS1, Section 3 regarding unstaffed platforms apply.
