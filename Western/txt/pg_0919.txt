       stand down as PiC. They must confirm this with the signaller who must record it on the sheet provided.
       When the train is ready to depart from the oil terminal, the shunter must contact the signaller to identify whether or not a
       PiC is on duty. If no PiC is on duty then they will assume the role and provide their name and contact telephone number to
