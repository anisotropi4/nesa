    9. Signaller sets up the berth triggered broadcast at the correct signal berth(s).
    10. Signaller will maintain the protecting signal at danger with a reminder appliance applied. This is the signal where
        the Signaller would stop and caution the train under current conditions.
    11. Broadcast made automatically to each train occupying the designated berth(s) and is received by the Driver
    12. The Signaller shall monitor GSM-R to determine whether the message has failed, and the failure code is
        displayed on the fixed terminal.
    13. A failed message will have a ‘cannot be sent’ message or ‘failure’ message on the fixed terminal.
    14. The message is broadcast automatically over the loud speaker in the Drivers cab
    15. When the Driver is involved in another call the broadcast will be seen as a call waiting on the cab radio display. If
        the Driver terminates the call within 20 seconds the message will be broadcast over the loudspeaker.
    16. The Driver acknowledges that the message has been received and that it has been understood by pressing the
        ST button on the radio head.
    17. The protecting signal is maintained at danger until the signaller has received an acknowledgement from the
        approaching train at a signal in rear of the signal being held at danger. The acknowledgement will be a
        ‘acknowledge’ message from the Driver.
    18. The reminder appliance will be removed, and the protecting signal cleared when the Signaller receives the
        acknowledgement before the signal being held at danger (see special instructions).
    19. If the ST acknowledgement is not received or is received after the set location the signal remains at danger and
        the Driver obeys all signals as normal.
    20. When the train has passed the protecting signal, the protecting signal is replaced to danger and the reminder
        appliance applied.
    21. When the caution message is received and acknowledged by the Driver they continue without stopping and obey
        the speed restriction and all signals.
