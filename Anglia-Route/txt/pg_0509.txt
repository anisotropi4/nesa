Signal UR139
When approaching signal UR139 at danger, drivers should bring their train to a stand at the triangular ‘exclamation mark’
board (white with a red border) positioned 158 metres on the approach to signal UR139.
This is intended to prevent electric trains from coming to a stand within the overhead line neutral section in the vicinity of
the signal.
Drivers should take care not to bring their train to a stand over the AWS magnet associated with signal UR139.
A telephone is provided at the board to enable drivers to contact the signaller in accordance with Rule Book Module S4.
                                                                                                            Dated: 09/05/11

BARKING
Due to the capacity of the current feeding arrangement in the Barking area, no more than two electric freight trains per
hour can pass through Barking between 0600 – 1000 each day.
This restriction does not affect the running of electric passenger services or non-electric freight.
                                                                                                            Dated: 29/08/18

unit stock. Any other category of train must travel at the lower speed.
                                                                                                            Dated: 07/12/13

Barking Freightliner Terminal
An Overheight Vehicle Alarm system is provided at the exits from Barking Freightliner Terminal to warn staff when an out
of gauge vehicle leaves the terminal. If the alarm sounds, the Shunter must advise the Signaller at Upminster IECC as
soon as possible and arrange for the train to be brought to a stand as quickly as possible.
                                                                                                            Dated: 05/08/06

Ripple Lane exchange sidings
In the event of the CTRL AC traction current being discharged or isolated on the Down or Up Ripple Lane Chord lines,
signalling controls will automatically replace and/or maintain UR823, 825 and 827 signals at danger for a route towards
AF095 and AF101.
In these circumstances, if there is a requirement for a non-electric train to proceed towards CTRL infrastructure, the
Upminster IECC signaller can authorise the driver to pass the signal at danger in accordance with Rule Book Module S5
Part A Passing Signals at Danger, stating the reason for passing the signal at danger is due to the AC overhead line been
isolated.
Rule Book Module S5 Part A Section 1.1 is modified accordingly.
