Anglia Route Sectional Appendix Module AR1




Working of traffic on a reception line/siding
When vehicles are to be placed on a Reception Line/Siding through a connection not operated from a signal box, the
person-in-charge must first obtain permission from the Signaller, giving details of the movement involved. Should the
movement be contrary to the direction in which trains normally enter the Reception Line/Siding, the Signaller must be
advised when the vehicles are at a stand and no further backward movement is to be made. In such circumstances, the
Signaller must not allow a train to enter the Reception Line/Siding until he has received this advice.
A tail lamp must be placed on the rearmost vehicle facing the direction from which trains normally enter the Reception
Line/Siding. Where a Reception Line/Siding is normally worked in both directions, a tail lamp must be placed at both ends
of the vehicles. The lamp must show a red light after sunset and during fog or falling snow.
