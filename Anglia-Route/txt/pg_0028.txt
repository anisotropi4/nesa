Dynamic Risk Assessment
Anglia Route

This notice is to advise that Dynamic Risk Assessment process is authorised for use under trial conditions.
The purpose of DRA is to provide a continuous assessment of risk in the rapidly changing circumstances of an operational
incident, in order to implement control measures necessary to make certain of an acceptable level of safety.
Its application should be applied by operational management staff seeking to assess operational system risk, and identify
control measures that deliver a safety benefit in rapidly changing operational incidents affecting the normal operation of
the railway.
The Scope of DRA is currently restricted for trial purposes to London South Eastern route (Anglia, Kent Sussex), LNW
route, Scotland route and Western Route.
DRA can only be facilitated and implemented by those trained to do so.
