Providing additional protection by use of a track circuit operating device (T-COD)
TCOD’s may be used to provide additional protection on the following sections of line listed below subject to the
restrictions shown:-
• Must not be used on track circuits between the signals protecting a RC or CCTV level crossing and the track circuit
     that passes through the crossing deck. On bi-directional and single lines, TCOD’s must not be used between the
     signals protecting the crossing.

•      Must not be used where there are check rails.
•      Must not be used within Axle Counter Areas
•      TCOD’s are best used clear of points and crossings and not in overlap track circuits. If it is necessary for a TCOD to
       be used in the vicinity of points, the Signaller must before giving permission consider the implications of track circuit
       controls etc. on other lines, particularly if the points will need to be moved during the time the TCOD is in use.
