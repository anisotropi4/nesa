Setting back movements from Up Slow Line. When signal WH.597 is cleared for a movement to set back from the Up
Slow Line to the sidings, the ‘OFF’ indicator in the Shunter's plunger cabinet will be illuminated. Provided the line is clear
for the movement to be made, the Shunter must then depress the ‘OFF’ plunger to illuminate the white light set back
signals which will be the Driver's authority to make the setback movement without receiving a handsignal from the
Shunter. The Driver must remain at the Luton end of the locomotive during the set back movement.
The Shunter must immediately extinguish the white lights by means of the 'Stop' plunger in case of emergency.
