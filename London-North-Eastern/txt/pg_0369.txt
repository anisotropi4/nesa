       Darlington Down Sidings

       There are still incidents occurring where trains booked for Down Sidings are stopping in Platform 4B in advance of T888
       signal and then authorised forward into the Sidings by the Ground Frame Operator once 1080 points have been set in
       Reverse position.
       This is unacceptable and could be categorised as a SPAD. To prevent this from happening, the process below must be
       followed:
       - Passing T888 towards Down sidings can only be authorised by the signaller.
       - Any driver requiring to enter the Down Sidings must stop their train in rear of T888 signal and contact the signaller before
       making any further movements.
       - Once the signaller has been contacted and 1080 points have been set in reverse position, the signaller can then
       authorise the driver to pass T888 signal at Danger and go forward to the Down Sidings.
