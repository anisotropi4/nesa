Shunting at Bardon Hill Ground Frame. A loud sounding bell, situated at the exit from the sidings is provided to assist
with the running of through trains. This bell will be operated by the Signaller at Bardon Hill box when it is necessary to
clear the Main lines for through trains and the Person in Charge of the shunting movement must arrange for shunting on
the main lines to cease immediately.
Wrong direction movements may be made on the Down Goods line from Bardon Hill Ground Frame (rear of signal BH.10)
to position light shunting signal BH.14 at Bardon Hill box.
When there is a failure of the rail clamp locks, the points operator must report the failure to the Signaller at Bardon Hill box
and act in accordance with the Signaller's instructions.

When the 'OFFâ€™ Indicator on the Up Goods line, working in conjunction with the shunting signal applying to setting back
movements from the Up Goods line to the Up Sidings, is illuminated, the Driver may commence the set back movement
without receiving a handsignal from the Shunter but he must proceed cautiously, keeping a sharp lookout and be prepared
to act on a handsignal from the Shunter when the latter comes into view.
