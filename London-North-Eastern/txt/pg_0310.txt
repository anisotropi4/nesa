       HERTFORD NORTH To Langley Junction (ENIF Test Track)
       The European Train Control System (ETCS) is the name used to describe a new signalling, control and train
       protection system. It is a component of the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS). In order to
       de-risk the national implementation of ERTMS a test facility has been provided to test signalling suppliers’
       equipment. This will be known as the ETCS National Integration Facility (ENIF) and consists of:
         • A testing laboratory situated at Hitchin.
         • A test site between Molewood Junction and Bragbury Junction on the Down Hertford loop line.
         • A test train which is a converted 313 EMU specially fitted with ETCS equipment.
       These instructions apply to operations on and around the ENIF test track. Except where stated below, there is
       no change to method of operation outlined in the national rules and procedures.
       Overview of ENIF Test Track
       The operations for the ENIF Test Track are built upon the signalling changes which are set out in the
       ‘Supplementary Notice of Signalling and Permanent Way Alterations’ (yellow signalling notice) NR/LNE No.
       29.
       The route between Molewood Junction and Bragbury Junction is signalled for the ‘Down direction’ on the
       Down Line. The Up Line is signalled for bi-directional working. During the time the ENIF Test Track is in use
       all service traffic will travel on the Up Line in both directions.
