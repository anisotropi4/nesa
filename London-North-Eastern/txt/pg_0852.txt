Dividing of Trains
Where specified in the Working Timetable, an Up train may be divided in the Up platform, with the front portion going on to
York and the rear portion remaining at Knaresborough to form a service back towards Leeds.
Two train crews will be provided.
Once the train has been divided, the front portion will attach a tail lamp, and provided the driver has the token and the train
has been signalled to Cattal, it may then go forward.
If the rear portion needs to draw forward towards the tunnel to clear the crossover, this movement must not be made until
the front portion has passed K2 signal and it has been authorised by the signaller at Knaresborough SB.
                                                                                                            Dated: 28/12/18
