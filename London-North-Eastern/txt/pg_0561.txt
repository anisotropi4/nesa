       Due to restricted clearances traincrew must not put their heads out of the train while passing over this route.
       Owing to restricted ‘window box’ clearances along the route, passenger trains composed of stock with opening windows
       (other than those of the “ventilator” type) are prohibited from traversing this section of track, except where special authority
       is granted. When authority is granted for passenger trains the following conditions apply:
       1. The train running must be published in Special Traffic Notice.
       2. To mitigate the risk of limited clearances to passengers while passing through the tunnels along this route:
          a) All passengers must be advised by public address and in writing not to lean out of windows;
          b) The train must be staffed by a Train Manager and Stewards, who will be briefed by the Train Manager;
          c) Prior to passing through the tunnels on this route, an announcement must be made using the public address
             system to instruct all passengers not to lean out of the windows during the passage of the train through the
             tunnels. Stewards must pass through all vehicles and repeat the instruction to all passengers.

       situated between Kentish Town and Farringdon stations.

       displaying a green or double yellow aspect after a reasonable time, the Driver must contact the Signaller at Three Bridges

       Entire Line Of Route – Traction changeover failure arrangements
       The normal traction changeover point from AC to DC in the down direction (ie from St. Pancras) will be
       Farringdon.

       If the traction changeover fails, the driver must inform the Signaller at Three Bridges Core South workstation
       before leaving Farringdon. The train will be signalled into City Thameslink station using the AC traction power
       so the driver can change ends and be signalled back towards Farringdon.
