       PERMISSIVE WORKING ON THE DOWN SIHPLEY SLOW BETWEEN L4027 AND L4045 SIGNALS

       Permissive working is permitted between L4037 and L4045 for the purpose of having a light engine proceed towards a
       freight train that has arrived from the Rylstone Branch. This movement is only permitted, provided the train engine has not
       been released from its train, and the run-round procedure has not commenced.
       If the train arriving from Rylstone Quarry is in a Top & Tail formation, the rear engine may only be detached and signalled
       from L4042 provided the leading train engine has not been detached from its train.

       Detaching of Cripples. A Down train which activates the Hot Axle Box Detector will be stopped at L.4031 signal for initial
       examination. If it has to detach cripples, it will be routed via the Down Shipley Fast line and detached vehicles must be
       placed in the Shunt Spur of the Up Sidings. If there are too many vehicles in front of the cripple, and it is necessary to
       place vehicles on the Up Shipley Main, such vehicles must be secured by the application of a sufficient number of
       handbrakes. It may be necessary, after vehicles have been placed in the Shunt Spur, to obtain the Signaller's permission
       to pass L4553 signal in accordance with Rule Book Module S5.
       An Up train which activates the HABD will be stopped for initial examination at L4046 signal. If there are cripples to
       detach, these must be placed in the Up Sidings.
       Rylstone Branch: Any train or locomotive which passes onto the branch must pass completely beyond L4039 signal before
       returning. Locomotives (only), coupled together if more than one, may be stabled in the platform at Skipton beyond L4039
       signal. All locomotives which pass onto the branch at Skipton together must also return together and locomotives must
       not be left at Rylstone for a later train.
