       RAILWAY CRIME
       All railway staff must be vigilant to railway crime and cable theft, and report any suspicious activity on the operational
       railway, or in the area of electrical substations, to the controlling signaller.
       Some examples of suspicious activity could be:
         • Anyone not wearing appropriate PPE, or that do not appear to have a safe system of work.
         • Anyone not responding to a train drivers warning, or appearing to hide as trains or people approach.
         • Vehicles that do not have any company markings or logos
         • Signalling location cabinets with doors open or missing, or troughing lids newly disturbed, with no staff nearby.
         • People ‘loitering’ in the area of electrical substations.
       In such cases, please inform the controlling signaller as quickly as possible giving precise location details. Drivers do not
       need to stop their trains immediately to report this, unless they consider it a safety of the line issue.

       SEMI-AUTOMATIC TRAIN WARNING SYSTEM (SATWAS)
       Network Rail (NR) is improving track worker safety, by introducing higher integrity warning systems that do not require
       lookouts to be positioned to warn of approaching trains, these systems include SATWS.
       SATWS will give track workers sufficient audio and visual warning of approaching trains within the required derived
       warning time (minimum 25 seconds, maximum of 45 seconds) to locations where sighting of trains is difficult and / or traffic
       density is high, precluding line blocks being taken for protection and to meet NR’s target of zero unassisted lookout
       working.
       The SATWAS system applies to the following locations and lines of route.
