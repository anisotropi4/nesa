Preferred Method of Working for shunting movements involving 80x units towards Leeds on the Up Harrogate
    -   A train enters Harrogate Station on the Down Harrogate from H64 signal.
    -   The train unloads passengers on Platform 1, as the trains are overlength the signaller must clear H57 signal to
        allow the trains to move up to existing stop car markers (9 or 10) so the train fits behind H26.
    -   The driver swaps end (9 car) or the second driver takes control of the train (10 car).
    -     The signaller routes the train onto the Up Harrogate (H26 to LH4138 via H61 points)
    -     Only when LH4138 displays a proceed aspect, the train can proceed up to new rear clear markers (9 or 10)
          enabling the train to fit behind H63 PLS.
    -     The driver swaps end (9 car) or the first driver takes control of the train (10 car).
    -     H63 and H32 PLS are cleared by the signaller, and the train is routed into the Down Siding.
    -     The train is stabled in the Down Siding.
    -     To continue to Leeds, the Signaller will clear H30 towards H24 signal.
    -     The train is signalled back to Leeds on the Up Harrogate.

Non-preferred Method of Working for Shunting movements involving 80x units towards Starbeck on the Up York
   -   A train enters Harrogate Station on the Down Harrogate from H64 signal.
   -   The train unloads passengers on Platform 1, as the trains are overlength the signaller must clear H57 signal to
       allow the trains to move up to existing stop car markers (9 or 10) so the train fits behind H26.
   -   As the train has already passed H57 at a proceed aspect, once the passengers are unloaded, the first driver
       continues onto the Up York until H56.
   -   When shunting into forward section has been sent and acknowledged by Starbeck signal box H56 can be cleared
       into the block section towards Starbeck, the train then proceeds up to the new rear clear markers (9 or 10). The
       signaller replaces H56.
   -   The driver swaps end (9 car) or the second driver takes control (10 car).
   -   H51 shunt signal is cleared by the signaller, and the train is routed via H23 into Platform 3, up to H24.
   -   When the train is confirmed clear of the AB section complete with tail lamp, shunt withdrawn to be sent and
       acknowledged by Starbeck signal box
   -   The driver swaps end (9 car) or the first driver takes control (10 car).
   -   H32 PLS is cleared by the signaller, and the train is routed into the Down Siding.
   -   The train is stabled in the Down Siding.
   -   To continue to Leeds the Signaller will clear H30 PLS towards H24 signal.
The train is signalled back to Leeds on the Up Harrogate.
Stabling of Trains or vehicles on the Through Road.
1.Trains may be stabled on the Through Road between signals 59 and 25.
2.The following conditions must be observed:-
         a) During darkness, fog or falling snow, lamps exhibiting red lights must be placed on the outer ends of the
         stabled vehicles.
         b) When a movement is required to enter the line towards the stabled vehicles for any purpose, the Driver must
         be instructed to proceed forward cautiously.
