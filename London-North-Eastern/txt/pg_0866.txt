London North Eastern Route Sectional Appendix Module LN7




LN924 - APPERLEY JN. TO ILKLEY
Entire Line Of Route

Train Operated Warning System. Provided continuously from Apperley Jn to the east end of Ilkley station platforms,
sections C1 - C16.
On a double line, each TOWS section covers both lines. The junction areas of branches are part of the main line TOWS
section.
Some TOWS sections include places where trains can stand for a short while in stations or may reverse - remember that
the Rule Book tells you to move clear if the warning continues to sound and no train comes.
Operation of the TOWS system is by means of a special key. Turning a key switch either way will change the state of the
system in that TOWS section to the opposite one; if it is on it will go off and if it is off it will go on. The key switches do not
have a specific on or off position.
Key switches are normally positioned back to back on a lineside post. These either control parts of the same TOWS
section or parts of adjacent TOWS sections. When you turn on the TOWS, you can only turn it off again at either the
same switch or the next switch along the line in the correct direction, i.e. if the switch you turned it on by was on the Leeds
side of the post, you must use the next switch towards Leeds to turn it off, or vice versa.




         If the system is turned on at 2 it can be turned off at 2 or 3 but not at 1 or 4.

                      These instructions are for your SAFETY and supplement those in the Rule Book,
                                            they do not replace or change them.

                                                                                                                Dated: 02/12/06
