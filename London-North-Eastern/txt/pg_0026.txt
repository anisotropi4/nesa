Rule Book Module TW1 - Preparation and movement of
trains : Brake systems
Section 4.4 – Coaching stock vehicles with isolated brakes
On the sections of line listed below a train formed of a 2 car Multiple Unit must not be worked with the brake isolated on
one vehicle or a 3 car Multiple Unit worked with the brake isolated on 2 vehicles. An assisting train must be attached so
that the proportion of vehicles isolated does not exceed 1 in 4 if 2x2 car units are involved or 2 in 5 if a 3 car and 2 car unit
are involved. A single Class 153 with brakes isolated must be assisted by at least 2 Class 153 or a 2 car unit.
The same proportion of vehicles must be applied to longer train formations, e.g. 3x2 car not more than 2 vehicles to be
isolated.
lternatively a locomotive can be provided to assist the train at the front.
If the first vehicle (or a Class 153) has the brake isolated the train must be assisted from the front.
