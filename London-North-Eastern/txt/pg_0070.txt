London North Eastern Route Sectional Appendix Module LN1
The Signaller must be advised and they must check that the normal indication has been restored, advising the COSS and
make an entry in the train register.
Obtaining permission to use a LOD (P)
The COSS must telephone the Signaller giving their Name, Employer, location and contact telephone number. They must
state which “lockout” section(s) they require to be protected and for how long. The COSS should be aware and record
clearly on the SSOW briefing pack that traffic will still be able to be signalled and run normally in one direction within the
protected area and confirms this with the signaller. If use of the “lockout” is agreed, the Signaller must record these details
in the train register book and repeat them back to the COSS who must confirm they are correct. The Signaller should then
instruct the COSS to insert the Key and turn it to the operate position, the signaller will then operate the release and
instruct the COSS to operate the “Patrol” button / switch. The COSS should then observe the “Patrol” indication has
illuminated correctly and advise the signaller, then turn the key to the normal position and remove the KEY.
When permission to use the LOD (P) is to be given up
When the protected area(s) is to be given up, the COSS must advise the Signaller of his/her Name, Employer and
location. When advised to do so by the Signaller, the COSS must insert the Key, turn it to the “operate” position and
observes the “Patrol” indication illuminates. The signaller then operates the “Traffic Cancel Control” and COSS operates
the “traffic” button / switch to return it to the “traffic” position. The COSS should then observe the “traffic” indication has
illuminated correctly and advise the signaller then turn the key to the normal position and extract the Key. The Signaller
must be advised and they must check that the normal indication has been restored, advising the COSS and make an
entry in the train register.
