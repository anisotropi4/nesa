London North Eastern Route Sectional Appendix Module LN8


        (i)        Having returned the token to an instrument, the driver or ground frame operator must clearly state, the
                   location, train reporting number, inform the signaller that the train has arrived complete with tail lamp and
                   the token has been replaced.
        (ii)       The driver may request permission from the signaller to withdraw a token for the next section (naming the
                   token stations).
        (iii)      When the driver is in possession of a token he must request “Permission to proceed past the Stop Board”
                   (naming the token station) to the next location (naming the token station).
        (iv)       If in a position to do so, the signaller will grant permission to proceed past the Stop Board (naming the
                   token station) to the next location (naming the token station).
        Note: Obtaining the token and permission to proceed from Glaisdale to Whitby does not exempt the driver from
        stopping at the Stop Board at Sleights.
3.      GROSMONT INTERMEDIATE TOKEN INSTRUMENT
3.1.1      When a train is required to proceed from the North Yorkshire Moors Railway on to the Network Rail single line,
           the driver must firstly request the Grosmont signaller to release the Annett’s Key. Then he/she must obtain the
           signaller at Nunthorpe’s permission before withdrawing a token from the instrument. When requesting
           permission, the driver must state the train’s identity, and the place to which it is to proceed.
3.1.2      The driver or competent person will proceed to the ground frame and operate the points for the movement to take
           place.
3.3        After the train has passed clear of the points, the driver or competent person must reset the points before
           proceeding.
3.4        When a train is required to proceed from Network Rail onto the North Yorkshire Moors Railway, the driver will
           bring his train to a stand clear of the points operated by the ground frame at Grosmont. Then he/she must obtain
           from the signaller at Grosmont permission to withdraw the Annett’s key to operate the ground frame and
           ascertain which line he is to proceed over.
3.5        The driver or competent person will proceed to the ground frame and operate the points for the movement to take
           place
3.6        After the train has passed clear of the ground frame points on to the North Yorkshire Moors Railway complete
           with tail lamp, the driver or competent person must reset the points to normal, replace the token in to the
           intermediate instrument and advise the signaller at Nunthorpe that the train is inside clear complete with tail lamp
           and that the token has been restored. He/she must then return the Annett’s key to the North Yorkshire Moors
           Railway instrument and notify the signaller at Grosmont that the movement is complete.
4.         HANDLING OF TOKEN
4.1        The driver must keep the token unless it is required by the Ground Frame Operator to release a ground frame as
           detailed below in 4.2 and 4.3. The train must not then proceed on its journey until shunting is completed, the
           points have been locked in the proper position for trains to pass on the running line and the Ground Frame
           Operator has returned the token to the driver.
4.2         When the train has reached the next token station complete with tail lamp, the driver must deliver the Token to
           the signaller at Nunthorpe, the Ground Frame Operator or place it in the instrument and immediately advise the
           signaller he has done so.
4.3        When an Up train arrives for the NYMR at Grosmont or a Down train arrives for Platform 2 at the Whitby Point
           Set Indicator the Driver must surrender the Token to the Ground Frame Operator who will then be responsible for
           checking the train is complete with tail lamp, the ground frame is normalised and for returning the token to the
           instrument. The signaller at Nunthorpe should then be advised.
5.             OCCUPATION OF SINGLE LINE FOR SHUNTING AT GLAISDALE OR LONG
           TRAIN AT GLAISDALE
           Any shunting movement out of a loop must proceed beyond the points indicator before returning.
           A competent person (other than a member of the traincrew) must be appointed at Glaisdale to supervise the
           token arrangements as follows:-
           (i)     When it is necessary for a locomotive to run round its train, the competent person must obtain the tokens
                   for the Battersby to Glaisdale and Glaisdale to Whitby sections. The driver must be handed the token for
                   the single line section he requires to occupy before the locomotive commences the run round movement.
                   When the run round movement has been completed and the tokens replaced in the instruments, the
                   signaller must be advised. When the train is ready to proceed the provisions of Regulation 2 must then be
                   observed in order for the train to proceed.
        (ii)       When a train is too long to be accommodated within the crossing loop, the signaller will not authorise the
                   driver of a train in the opposite direction to withdraw a token and proceed until he has received an
                   assurance from the competent person that the long train has passed clear into the loop.
6.         TRAIN REQUIRING TO STOP OR REVERSE IN SECTION
6.1        If a train is to reverse at a point in the section and return to the token station at which it entered the section, the
           driver must inform the signaller when the token is withdrawn. If there is a telephone to the signaller at the point
           where the train reverses, or contact can be made by radio, the driver must inform the signaller on arrival, and
           again, when the train is ready to depart.
