       Methodology
       Signaller records the berth triggered safety broadcast to a set script and stores it on the system.
       Signaller sets up the berth triggered safety broadcast at the appropriate signal berth.
       Signaller will maintain the protecting signal at danger. This is the signal where the Signaller would stop and caution the train if
       the Signaller does not receive the acknowledgement.
       The safety broadcast will be made automatically to each train occupying the designated berth(s).
       The Driver acknowledges that the safety broadcast has been received and that it has been understood by pressing the ST
       Button.
       The protecting signal is maintained at danger until the signaller has received an acknowledgement from the approaching
       train. The acknowledgement will be an ‘Acknowledgement’ (ACK) message from the Driver.
       The protecting signal may be cleared when the Signaller receives the acknowledgement message.
       If the acknowledgement message is not received by the Signaller the protecting signal remains at danger and the Driver
       obeys all signals as normal. The driver should contact the relevant signaller at the earliest opportunity, if brought to a stand,
       as per the rule book requirements”
       When the caution message is received and acknowledged by the Driver they will continue to obey all signals and apply the
       appropriate rule over the section of line.
