ANIMALS ON THE LINE
NOTICE TO TRAINCREW, SIGNALLERS AND CONTROLLERS

Where the rules and regulations (General Signalling Regulation 18.2 and Rule Book Module TW1 section 20) require that
trains be cautioned because of animals on the line, this procedure need not be applied providing that the animals are:
        domestic, for example, dogs
        deer
        not more than six sheep
However, drivers are still required to make an initial report of the animals being ‘on the line’ and maintenance response
teams are mobilised to establish where the animals gained access to the line and where necessary effect repairs.
Once a report is received from a driver, then a general call will be put out via GSM-R / CSR to all trains in the area,
advising them of the approximate vicinity of the incursion and that they are not required to stop to report the incident.
Drivers are advised that if they believe the safety of trains is at risk then they are instructed to carry out the relevant
provisions of the Rule Book.

SWANS ON THE LINE
A train need only be cautioned for a swan on the line if the swan is reported to be within the “four foot” of the line
concerned
