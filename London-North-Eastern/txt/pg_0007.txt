       Mainline Turnback Boards

       Trackside retroreflective Mainline Turnback Boards are installed at locations to act as a further Driver Aid so that the Driver
       can be assured that the rear of their train (dependant of unit length) is clear of the controlling Track Circuit to facilitate a
       Turnback Manoeuvre from the track circuitry associated with that Signal. These signs are primarily for Class 700 trains and
       are formed of white squares with black lettering and border, photographs illustrate the two types: -




       It is to be noted that there are usually 2 Turnback Boards for every Signal. One that is denoted TB 210m and the other which
       is denoted TB 275m. The board stating TB 210m has been positioned to ensure a Class 700 RLU (Reduced Length Unit)
       which is formed of 8 carriages of approx. 20m and allowing for a Signal Standback of 15 m. When the driver of a Class 700
       RLU is parallel to that sign they are clear of the controlling circuit at the rear of their unit. Similarly, with a 12 Car unit\FLU
       (Full Length Unit) once parallel with TB 275m sign the unit will be in a position to safely undertake a Turnback
       Procedure\Manoeuvre. These signs have been designed to also act as reference points for Driverâ€™s of alternative rolling
       stock to show meterage from the controlling circuit.
       It is to be noted that these signs are purely a Driver Aid and contact with the Signaller to clarify the safe positioning of the
       train to undertake any Turnback Procedure is still required.
