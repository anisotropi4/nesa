       TW5 SECTION 24 – KNOWN MISROUTED CALL LOCATIONS

       The locations in the table below are known areas where calls are frequently misrouted to the wrong signaller. Calls
       may misroute to the wrong signaller if the ‘contact signaller’ button is pressed.

       Drivers are instructed to use the phone book to contact the signaller from these locations.

       TW5 SECTION 24 – KNOWN NON-TD REGISTRATION LOCATIONS

       The locations in the table below are known areas where the lack of Train Describers results in registration problems.
       There will also be a likelihood of misrouted calls to the signaller if the ‘contact signaller’ button is pressed.

       Drivers are instructed to register using the wildcard and not follow GSM-R bulletin 21 until the alias plates are added
       to the signals. The Driver is also instructed to use the phone book to contact the signaller from these locations.

       LIMITED COVERAGE ON FREIGHT ONLY BRANCH LINES

       The freight-only branch lines listed in the table below are sections of permanent poor GSM-R coverage. These
       areas of poor coverage are in tunnels and deep cuttings resulting in GSM-R calls may be unreliable, as with
       previous NRN coverage. If a train is in a poor coverage area at the time the emergency call is initiated, the train
       radio will receive the emergency call as soon as there is sufficient GSM-R coverage.

       GSM-R FAULTS AND FAILURES RESPONSE

       VERSION 1.1

       PURPOSE

       To provide guidance on the response to onboard GSM-R system faults and local/area infrastructure faults.

       Appendix covers the response to system faults from a single fixed terminal through to failures of the infrastructure
       resulting in loss of coverage in a geographical area.
