    •    Ensure a conflicting inward or outward movement has not been authorised between Broughton Lane Junction
         and Tinsley Yard and
    •    Obtain permission from the shunter for the train to proceed towards AVESTA level crossing and
    •    Instruct the driver to disregard W226 signal, which has been restricted to a red aspect, ensuring that W316 points
         are in the correct position for the movement and
    •   Instruct the driver to proceed towards AVESTA level crossing and await the shunters instructions
The shunter or driver must also be instructed to confirm that the movement is in clear at Tinsley Yard complete with tail
lamp.

    •    The shunter or driver confirms that the inward movement is in clear at Tinsley Yard complete with tail lamp

LN810 - SHEPCOTE LANE WEST JN TO TINSLEY SOUTH JN
Working of trains into Tinsley Yard

The Woodburn Junction Signaller must contact the Tinsley Yard Shunter to obtain permission for a train to proceed
towards Tinsley Avesta TMO Level crossing stop board, before setting the route from W205 signal to W226 signal. W226
signal position prevents a freight train from stopping at the signal due to a steep rising gradient on approach; therefore an
aspect control has been applied to W205 to prevent the route up to W226 signal from clearing unless W226 signal is off.
Confirmation from the shunter or driver that the movement in is clear at Tinsley Yard complete with tail lamp is not
required.
The Woodburn Junction Signaller must contact the Tinsley Yard Shunter to obtain permission for a train to proceed
towards Tinsley Avesta TMO Level crossing stop board, before setting the route from W212 signal to W228 signal.
Confirmation from the shunter or driver that the movement in is clear at Tinsley Yard complete with tail lamp is not
required.
