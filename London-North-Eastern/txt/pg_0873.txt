       BRADFORD INTERCHANGE

       Loco-hauled train running round
       The maximum number of coaching stock vehicles running round is 9.
       Platform 1
       Passing MM6261 and MM6251 at danger
       If a failure requires MM6261 and MM6251 to be passed at danger, authority to pass both signals can be granted with a
       single instruction from MM6261. Both MM6261 and MM6251 are fitted with TPWS.
       Platform 1 and 3 lines
       If the Driver of a train standing at signal M1578 on No.1 Platform line or signal M1576 on No.3 Platform line needs to
       speak to the Signaller, he should do so from the telephone on the end of the respective platform.
       Platform 3
       Freight trains are prohibited from being routed into Platform 3 except during a T3 possession. This is due to the reduced
       slide length of the buffer stop design.
       If Freight trains are to be routed into Platform 3 under this restriction they must have a locomotive at both ends.
       Stabling Siding
       When train crew require access to or from the platform side of a train in the Stabling Siding, arrangements should be
       made with the Signaller at Mill Lane to block Platform 4 line. When all personnel are in a position of safety, the signaller
       must be advised immediately.
       Engine Release Line
       When train crew require access to or from the platform side of a train in the Engine Release Line, arrangements should be
       made with the Signaller at Mill Lane to block Platform 1 line. When all personnel are in a position of safety, the signaller
       must be advised immediately.
       Drivers of trains routed onto the Engine Release Line should exercise particular care in controlling the movement on the
       falling gradient. Stop blocks are not provided at the end of this line.
