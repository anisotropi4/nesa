       Single Line Working over the Down Shipley Main line - Rule Book, Module P1

       When Single Line Working is in operation over the Down Shipley Main line, it will not be necessary to appoint a
       Handsignaller for Up direction trains. Drivers of Up direction trains must be instructed by the Pilotman to obey signal
       L3890. Rule Book, Module P1,
       Section 3.5a) and 6.2a) are modified accordingly.
       Drivers of Up trains may be authorised to proceed without being accompanied by the Pilotman. Section 7.1 is modified
       accordingly.
       The above arrangements are applicable in all weather conditions.

       LN922 - WHITEHALL WEST JN TO HELLIFIELD SOUTH JN
       Armley Jn To SKIPTON

       Train Operated Warning System. Provided continuously from 196m 34ch (Armley Jn) to 221m 13ch (East of Skipton
       station) in 36 separate sections numbered A1 - 36.
       On a double line, each TOWS section covers both lines. The junction areas of branches are part of the main line TOWS
       section.
       Some TOWS sections include places where trains can stand for a short while in stations or may reverse - remember that
       the Rule Book tells you to move clear if the warning continues to sound and no train comes.
       Operation of the TOWS system is by means of a special key. Turning a key switch either way will change the state of the
       system in that TOWS section to the opposite one; if it is on it will go off and if it is off it will go on. The key switches do not
       have a specific on or off position.
       Key switches are normally positioned back to back on a lineside post. These either control parts of the same TOWS
       section or parts of adjacent TOWS sections. When you turn on the TOWS, you can only turn it off again at either the
       same switch or the next switch along the line in the correct direction, i.e. if the switch you turned it on by was on the Leeds
       side of the post, you must use the next switch towards Leeds to turn it off, or vice versa.




           If the system is turned on at 2 it can be turned off at 2 or 3 but not at 1 or 4.

                 These instructions are for your SAFETY and supplement those in the Rule Book,
                            they do not replace or change them.

       KEIGHLEY

       Keighley Down Sidings. The connection between the two sidings is worked by a free ground frame (ie. no key or release
       is required to operate it). The points are not trailable. Engineers machines may only be stabled in the siding furthest from
       the main line and the points must then be left towards the other siding.
