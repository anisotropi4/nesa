On passing the Down Distant board, the Driver must regulate the speed of his train in order to be able to stop at the Point
Indicator if it is not illuminated. Illumination of the Point Indicator means the points are set correctly for the Down Loop.
If a train is stopped due to the Point Indicator not being illuminated, the Driver must advise the Signaller using the
telephone at the Point Indicator.If the Point Indicator fails, a steady yellow flag during daylight, or a steady yellow lamp
during darkness, or fog, or falling snow, may be exhibited at the Point Indicator and the Driver may proceed over the
points.
