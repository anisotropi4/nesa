 London North Eastern Route Sectional Appendix Module LN1


 AUTOMATIC POWER CHANGEOVER SITES (APCo)
 As part of the introduction of the Intercity Express Train (IET) Balises and lineside signage has been installed at strategic
 locations across LNE, Anglia, LNW & Scotland. The track mounted Blaise’s communicate with the train which will
 automatically change traction mode between electric and diesel, either dynamically (shortly after passing the Balise), or
 statically when the train next comes to a stand (normally a station stop). Signage is not normally installed for APCo
 pantograph raise sites, however, signage is usually provided as a supplementary prompt to the driver to ensure the train has
 transitioned from electric to diesel with the pantographs safely lowered. APCo sites and associated signage may be for all
 trains or only selective trains or certain routes for which the trains should respond using the information held in the headcode
 for the service relative to the location. The sectional Appendix Table A and the Isolation Diagrams & Instructions for the route
 cover the locations.


 The following sign has been provided at the APCo zone. This sign is applicable to Bi-mode Class 800 and 802.

 as outlined in the Rule Book Modules for raising Pantographs. Other reminders or prompts for traction type changeover may
 also be in place.
