Drivers Call-by Plungers at Cricklewood Depot Level Crossing

Due to the close proximity of signals CD61, CD63 and CD65 to the level crossing, Drivers Call-By plungers have been
provided adjacent to the respective SPT in a locked (BR1 Key) cabinet. If during a failure of the level crossing, and before
an attendant arrives the Signaller may request the driver operates the call-buy plunger. Once the call-by plunger has been
operated the Signaller shall further instruct the driver, the Driver must satisfy themselves that the barriers are in the
lowered position, and the crossing is clear before proceeding.
Note: This instruction does not apply if the crossing is being locally operated.
