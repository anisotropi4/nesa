To be read in conjunction with General Notes.
Network Rail documentation may refer to either Mark 1-3 stock or C1-3 gauge as detailed below:
C1 = standard passenger coaching stock gauge for Mark 1 and Mark 2 coaches with 9’0” wide bodywork and 64’6” or (57’) long underframes.
C3 = standard passenger coaching stock gauge for Mark 3 coaches which are 23 metres (75’) long overall.
Mk3 (MOD) = Mk 3 coaches (Modified) and refers to Mk 3 coaches which have been fitted with powered bodyside plug doors.
Mk3 DVT (MOD) = Mk3 DVT (Modified) and refers to Mk3 DVTs that have had centre pivot lateral bump stops modified to ESG-S-MO15, reducing lateral body movement.
Mk4 DVTs can operate over all routes cleared for Mark 4 coaching stock. Any restrictions applied to Mk4 coaching stock also apply to Mk 4 DVTs.
Mk3 coaches used with Class 43 power cars and fitted with external power-operated sliding doors, manufactured by Vapor Stone Rail Systems, and CET are compatible with all routes shown as
cleared for Mk3 coaches.
