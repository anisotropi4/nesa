PONTEFRACT MONKHILL

When it is necessary because of engineering work or other degraded working or when requested by TRC in connection
with perturbed working to terminate and start a train at Pontefract Monkhill in the Down Platform (this is permitted for trains
proceeding in the Wakefield Kirkgate direction or the Castleford direction), the conductor must contact the signaller at
Prince of Wales signalbox on 03 75137 (internal) or 01904 525137 (BT) to discuss turn-back arrangements.
The conductor should advise the driver of the agreement reached with the signaller and should stand in such a position
that P362 ground position light signal is clearly visible when carrying out train dispatch procedures. The conductor is also
responsible for advising any passengers waiting on the up platform to cross to the Down platform via the footbridge.
The signaller should (unless the movements are preplanned) advise Network Rail Control of the altered turn-back
arrangements.
