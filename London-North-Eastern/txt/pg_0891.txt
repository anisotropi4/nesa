       LN914 - HULL (PARAGON) TO SEAMER WEST JN
       Hunmanby Station LC (ABCL-X)

       Down train on Down line – Additional requirements associated with train lengths.

       If it is necessary for a train with a length of more than 105 yards (96 metres) to pass over the crossing in the Down
       direction on the Down Bridlington line, the crossing must be under local control and the crossing lights switched on before
       the train is authorised to proceed beyond signal SR123.

       Reason for instruction:-
       Signal SR125 at the east end of Hunmanby Station is designed not to clear to a proceed aspect until a train has come to a
       stand at it. The design of the crossing means there is a possibility that the barriers will raise and the lights extinguish
       before a train with a length of more than 105 yards (96 metres) has passed clear of the crossing. Therefore, when such
       trains are planned to run over this route, arrangements must be made in advance for the crossing to be placed under local
       control.

       Up train on Up line

       Rule Book, Module TW8, Section 4 is modified as follows :-
       Because of the junction beyond the crossing, a Distant signal and stop signal are provided on the approach to the crossing
       instead of a Warning Board, Stop Board and White Flashing Light. An emergency plunger to activate the crossing when
       signal SR124 has to be passed at Danger is located at the signal.
       The normal sequence of signal and crossing operation (which requires all trains to stop) will be as follows :-
         • Train arrives in Up platform with signal SR124 at Danger.
         • Provided the Signaller has operated the signal for the train to depart, the crossing sequence will commence.
         • Signal SR124 will clear to Green when the crossing has operated correctly.
         • The train should then be despatched from the platform with the Driver observing Rule Book Module TW8, Section
           4.3.
         • The crossing cannot ‘time out’ whilst signal SR124 is displaying a green aspect.
       If a train is, or will be, detained in the platform for more than 2 minutes the driver must immediately communicate with the
       Signaller at Seamer.
       If signal SR124 fails to clear it will be necessary to consult the Signaller at Seamer. When authorising Signal SR124 to be
       passed at Danger, the Signaller will also remind the driver to operate the plunger. This should activate the crossing
       sequence. When the crossing has operated correctly, the miniature white light adjacent to the plunger will commence to
       flash. The Driver should advise the Guard that he is ready to be despatched from the platform and then observe Rule
       Book Module TW8, Section 4.3. The crossing can ‘time out’ 3 minutes after the plunger has been operated.
       If after operating the plunger in accordance with the above paragraph the miniature white light does not commence to
       flash, the crossing will either have failed or be partially failed e.g. a red road flashing light out and the Driver must act in
       accordance with the Rule Book Module TW8, Section 4.3b) and 4.5.
       Other approaches to the crossing

       For an Up train departing from the Down platform, Rule Book Module TW8, Section 4.3 applies except that reference to
       ‘white light adjacent to the crossing’ should be read as miniature white light adjacent to the plunger.
       For trains in the Down direction, Rule Book Module TW8, Section 4.2 applies except that with reference to Section 4.2c,
       operation of the plungers on the Down approach will fully initiate the operating sequence and provided that the Driver’s
       White Light is correctly displayed, it will not be necessary to treat the crossing as having failed.
