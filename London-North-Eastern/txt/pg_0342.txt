Electrification Depot

If a train has entered the electrification depot, no other train must be allowed to enter No.2 siding from either end until the
Signaller has received an assurance that the train in the electrification depot is clear of the connection and no further
movements will be made.
No movement must be made from the electrification depot which will foul No.2 siding without the authority of the Signaller
which may be given, provided the Signaller has not authorised a conflicting movement into No.2 siding.
