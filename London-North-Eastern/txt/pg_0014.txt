       Section 2, Clause 2.5 - Using a track circuit operating device T-COD

       Providing additional protection by use of a track circuit operating device (T-COD)
       Remotely activated T-Cod (e.g. ZKL): These devices are static devices permanently fitted to the rail. These devices are
       operated remotely and occupy a track circuit to provide additional protection in exactly the same way as a T-Cod, which is
       described in Rule Book Module TS1 Clause 13.2.4. These devices are authorised providing a Signalbox Special
       Instruction (SBSI) is in place.
       TCOD’s may be used to provide additional protection on the following sections of line listed below subject to the
       restrictions shown:-
       Must not be used on track circuits between the signals protecting a RC or CCTV level crossing and the track circuit that
       passes through the crossing deck. On bi-directional and single lines, TCOD’s must not be used between the signals
       protecting the crossing.

       • Must not be used where there are check rails.
       • Must not be used within Axle Counter Areas
       • TCOD’s are best used clear of points and crossings and not in overlap track circuits. If it is necessary for a TCOD to
         be used in the vicinity of points, the Signaller must before giving permission consider the implications of track circuit
         controls etc. on other lines, particularly if the points will need to be moved during the time the TCOD is in use.
         Routes and locations on which TCOD can be used
                                        Remarks, including Locations/Sections where TCOD
