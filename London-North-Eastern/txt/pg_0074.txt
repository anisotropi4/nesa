       LINE OF ROUTE NUMBER REPLICATION
       In order to facilitate production of 4 separate WONs for the LNE Territory (North, Centre, South and East Midlands), the
       NAU have allocated a second LOR number to all or part of some LORs listed in this appendix.
       Only one of the replicated LORs has been built into this Sectional appendix, and the following table shows the relationship
       between replications.
