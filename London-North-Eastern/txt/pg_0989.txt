Protection Arrangements – Rule Book Modules M1 And M2

Tyne and Wear Metro trains do not carry detonators, and as a result detonators will not be used when Emergency
Protection or Assistance Protection is carried out in accordance with Rule Book Module M1, Section 4 and Module M2,
Section 4.
When a Metro train is to be assisted by other than a Metro train, a mobile assistance team will be sent from Metro’s
Gosforth Depot. They will be equipped with an emergency coupler and detonators, and will assist the Metro Driver in
carrying out normal Assistance Protection and recovery arrangements.
