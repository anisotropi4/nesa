Entire Line of Route

Drivers of assisting locomotives called to rescue 12 car formation EMU stock must make no attempt to couple to the failed
train until the gradient profile, permitted load for the locomotive and brake force required has been assessed to be
adequate to control the combined formation.
Special care must be taken when using emergency adaptor couplers to move stock unbraked at 5mph to clear the line.
If in doubt NO attempt to couple to 12 car EMU stock formation should be made until these details have been provided.
Further restrictions on type of locomotive able to access MCL & CBI line of route are published in Table D4A (East
Midlands) â€“ Route clearance of locomotives.
In certain circumstances more than one locomotive may be required to achieve rescue.

soon as practicable after the train has stopped after which the engine must be shut down. Locomotives stabled at the
buffer stop end of the station must not be restarted until required to leave the station.

The buffer stop end power car must not be restarted until 10 minutes before the train is due to depart.
