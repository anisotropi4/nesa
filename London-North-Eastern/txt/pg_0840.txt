or run over the Down or Up line through Standedge Tunnel without the Signallerâ€™s authority. This instruction must also be
applied when the line is under Possession.
Emergency telephones connected to Huddersfield Workstation are installed at four points in the former Down Slow tunnel,
the single bore immediately adjacent (Up side) to the double line running tunnel. The telephones are attached to S&T
location cabinets and are not illuminated.
Access to the single bore tunnel can be obtained through cross passages and only the cross passages indicated below
may be used. These have a reflective sign showing a white telephone on a blue background. In addition, there are
numbered tablets along the wall of the running tunnel to assist in identifying where you are.
Other cross passages may not be safe to use and must not be used, some have vertical holes leading down into the canal
tunnel, which is at a lower level.
The locations of the telephones are as follows:
     Phone number                    Mileage                    Nearest tablet number

Standedge Tunnel Down Huddersfield

Rule Book Module S7, Section 5 & 6: Automatic Brake Activation
Restarting (at caution) trains on the Down Huddersfield in Standedge tunnel should there be an automatic brake
application by AWS /TPWS OSS for the 45 PSR:-
Following conformation by the Driver that they have had an automatic brake application by AWS /TPWS OSS for the 45
PSR the driver must ensure the train comes to a stand. If the Driver can then establish that the train is in a fit state to
proceed, the train may be restarted and proceed at caution (max 20mph) until the tunnel exit and only as far as HU701,
the driver must stop the train at HU701 even if the signal is displaying a proceed aspect. The Driver then contacts the
Signaller at the YROC Huddersfield WS via GSMR, or alight to use the signal post telephone (if GSMR is defective) to
inform the Signaller of the activation and follow the Rule book module instructions regarding further movement.
