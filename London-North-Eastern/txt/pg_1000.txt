       Ryhope Grange Sidings

       Trains entering the sidings are required to check the position of the hand points by observing the position flag prior to
       entering No. 1 or No. 2 siding. If the points are not lying in the position to enter the intended siding the train crew are
       required to operate the points to the correct lie. Note that when existing the sidings, the position of the points does not
       require checking as the points are trailable.


       When departing the sidings, the train crew are required to telephone the Signaller to seek authority to
       pass NS7125 or NS7217 Stop signs.
