London North Eastern Route Sectional Appendix Module LN8



When trains are clear inside the sidings & the ground frame has been restored, you must advise the signaller at
Freemans. You must retain the staff. If directed by the signaller, you must arrange to convey it to an alternative location. If
you are relieved or hand the staff to another person you must immediately advise details of the new PIC to the signaller. If
a train is stabled in the sidings during closure of Freemans signalbox, the staff may be left secured in the lockable cabinet
provided at North Blyth, subject to prior agreement with the signaller.
Before authorising a train to pass beyond the “Commencement of staff section” Boards at Battleship Wharf or North Blyth
sidings you must obtain the signallers permission. You must show the staff to the driver & operate the ground frame,
operate any level crossing before instructing the driver to proceed to the instruction board at Cambois TMO level crossing.
After the ground frame is restored you must proceed to Cambois TMO level crossing & deliver the key token to the driver
of the train before operating the crossing.
