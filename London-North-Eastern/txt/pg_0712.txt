       Instructions To Train Crews And Other Persons Concerned Working On Network Rail Lines Used By South
       Yorkshire P.T.E. Supertram Tram Train Services
       Supertram Tram Train services operate over the Parkgate Transfer Line. No other rolling stock is permitted to enter the
       Parkgate Transfer Line except W6A gauge yellow plant for the purposes of conducting engineering work and light engines
       assisting failed Class 399 Tram Train vehicles.
       The Parkgate Transfer Line is electrified at 750V DC overhead and must be regarded as live at all times. The provisions of
       Rule Book Module AC must be observed as far as is practicable. The overhead line equipment above and adjacent to the
       Parkgate Transfer Line is controlled by the Electrical Control at York. Any incident affecting the overhead line equipment
       must be reported to the Electrical Control Operator at York. (Int. 037 5622 Ext. 01904 525622).
       Class 399 Tram Train vehicles have a different profile to standard train vehicles and lack front yellow warning panels. The
       vehicle lighting is also non-standard incorporating lower intensity headlights and orange sidelights below sole bar level.
       The vehicle employs an electronic horn which has a different tone to a regular air horn. Train crews and persons working
       lineside should note the above differences between Tram Train vehicles and standard rolling stock.
       Hazard Warning Lights
       The Class 399 Hazard Warning Light arrangement is non-standard incorporating flashing orange indicator lights and
       orange side lights in tandem with flashing headlights, but at a lower frequency. Train crews and persons working lineside
       should note this difference from standard rolling stock for identifying a Tram Train vehicle in potential distress.
