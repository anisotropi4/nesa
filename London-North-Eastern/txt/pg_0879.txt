PERMISSIVE WORKING ON THE DOWN SIHPLEY SLOW BETWEEN L4027 AND L4045 SIGNALS

Permissive working is permitted between L4037 and L4045 for the purpose of having a light engine proceed towards a

been released from its train, and the run-round procedure has not commenced.
If the train arriving from Rylstone Quarry is in a Top & Tail formation, the rear engine may only be detached and signalled
from L4042 provided the leading train engine has not been detached from its train.
