GROSMONT

After obtaining the Network Rail token from the Driver to operate the ground frame for a movement to the North Yorkshire
Moors Railway, the Guard must obtain the North Yorkshire Moors Railway Annetts key and an assurance from the North
Yorkshire
Moors Railway Person in Charge at Grosmont that the points have been set for the intended movement, that no other
conflicting movement has been authorised and details of the line over which the train will travel.

GROSMONT

Steam locomotives working through Grosmont may take water from the water column situated between the main running
line and the North Yorkshire Moors platform line.
The water column is located at the east end of platform one.
When the water column is not in use the arm is locked in a safe position to prevent the arm swinging foul of the main
running line. This is achieved by the mechanism being locked by a 222 padlock.
When a driver wishes to obtain water, after placing the locomotive in the correct position he must unlock the water column
arm to enable this to be swung round to allow the locomotive to obtain water.
When the required amount of water has been obtained the arm must be swung back to it’s normal “not in use” safe
position followed by locking with the 222 padlock.
This 222 key also locks the token machine cabinets.
THE SECURING OF THE WATER COLUMN WHEN “NOT IN USE” IS THE DRIVERS RESPONSIBILITY
