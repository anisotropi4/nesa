       LN672 - WARDLEY TO PELAW JN
       Wardley

       Arriving Trains

       The Bunker Operator will be advised of an approaching train before it reaches Pelaw and asked to clear the slot on signal
       T.1.
       Provided the slot on T.1 signal has been cleared and the approaching train operates the treadle and track circuit PMW, the
       route will set and signal T.1 will normally clear for the approaching train. If for any reason T.1 signal fails to clear, the
       Driver must contact the Signaller at Tyneside who may instruct the Driver to operate the plunger located on the signal post
       and if the signal clears proceed.
       If signal T.1 still fails to clear the Signaller at Tyneside must be advised.
       Departing Trains

       The Driver of a train ready to depart must contact the Signaller at Tyneside and give details of the train. Permission may
       then be given to operate the plunger at signal T.12 which will set the route to signal T.2.
       If after operating the plunger signal T.12 does not clear the Signaller at Tyneside must be advised.
