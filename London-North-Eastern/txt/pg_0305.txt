Except when the level crossing is under local control, when a Driver is authorised to pass the Up Main signal U130 at
Danger, he must, before passing the signal, operate the special plunger in the telephone box or, if a Handsignaller is in
attendance, ensure that this has been done. Before proceeding over the level crossing, he must satisfy himself that the
barriers are in the fully lowered position.
